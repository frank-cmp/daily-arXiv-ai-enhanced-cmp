The base space of this fibre-bundle structure is a sphere (or a plane for a black brane) and the fibre is the two-dimensional Rindler spacetime. We launch a detailed study of probes in this geometry. We study particle geodesics and scalar fields. The first part of the paper constructs geodesics and probe scalar fields directly in the SC geometry. We then look at a wide class of examples, including the Schwarzschild BH and the Kerr BH in asymptotically flat spacetimes, the BTZ BH and the black brane in AdS spacetimes, as well as Lifshitz black holes and construct the explicit maps to the SC geometry to obtain results specific to each case. These results are reproduced by considering the probe particles and fields in the original BH background and taking the near-horizon limit of the solutions. Our encyclopedia of examples establishes the notion of SC geometries as near-horizon geometries of non-extremal black objects, paving the way for a detailed, intricate future analysis of the quantum aspects of this geometry."}

Tracing, quantifying, and identifying types of plastic waste is of crucial importance to understand its environmental pathways and develop targeted strategies for reduction, recycling, and remediation. To contribute to addressing this global issue, we investigated the spin-labeling capabilities of aqueous chlorine dioxide (ClO$_2$) radicals upon introduction into poly(ethylene terephthalate) and utilized electron spin resonance spectroscopy for detection. The technique is capable of identifying plastic species as the unpaired electron of the radical molecule is strongly sensitive to its local environment through its coupling parameters. Temperature-dependent measurements revealed that the molecules are immobilized at low temperatures and exhibit well-resolved anisotropic and hyperfine spectra that are quantitatively described by a model spin Hamiltonian. Even above the melting point of water, some degrees of freedom remain blocked as a result of the polymer matrix.

We demonstrate by equilibrium Monte-Carlo simulations that such a temperature-dependent change in recall patterns does occur in our model. Simulation results strongly indicate that the system undergoes a first-order phase transition when the change in recall patterns occurs.

A quantitative characterization of the resultant field-induced superconducting dynamics with spatio-temporal resolution remains challenging, particularly in two-dimensional materials. In this work, we analyze magnetic noise measured by the depolarization rate of a proximate single spin-qubit as a non-invasive probe of such dynamical fluctuations. We demonstrate that the temperature dependence of the magnetic noise spectrum near $T_c$ deviates from predictions based on quasiparticle excitations due to critical superconducting fluctuations, which in turn are enhanced by a weak applied field. By analyzing the magnetic noise due to vortex dynamics, we further show that noise spectroscopy is not only able to distinguish between different vortex phases, but also extract key physical quantities of interest, such as oscillation frequencies of pinned vortices, phonon dispersion of vortex lattices and vortex diffusivity in a vortex liquid. Complementing recent work on noise magnetometry of quasiparticle excitations and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions in two-dimensional superconductors without an applied field, our work highlights the ability of noise spectroscopy to reveal a wealth of superconducting dynamical phenomena in an applied field."}

Phase diagrams and scaling properties of elliptic models are compared to some of the experimental and numerical data accumulated over the past three decades.

However, the topological classification of systems respecting these symmetries, particularly for interacting fermions, remains incomplete. In this work, we systematically classify time-reversal symmetry-protected crystalline topological superconductors in two-dimensional interacting fermionic systems using an explicit real-space construction. Among the resulting phases, we identify intrinsically interacting fermionic topological superconductors, i.e., phases that cannot be realized in either free-fermion or interacting bosonic systems. For spinless fermions with protecting symmetry group $C_4 \\times Z_2^T$ or $D_4 \\times Z_2^T$ (plus fermion parity), the intrinsic sector has a $Z_4$ classification. The corresponding root phases generating this $Z_4$ classification admit a transparent real-space construction in terms of decorated 1D blocks. These blocks are 1D fermionic symmetry-protected topological (FSPT) phases, realizable as double Majorana chains. We further find the corresponding $Z_4$ spinless intrinsic phases for wallpaper groups $p4$, $p4m$, and $p4g$. We also find an additional $Z_2$ intrinsically interacting phase for spinless fermions with wallpaper group $pm$, which is absent with the corresponding point-group symmetry alone. Moreover, these intrinsic phases naturally give rise to higher-order FSPT phases that support corner zero modes. Finally, we verify the crystalline equivalence principle for generic 2D interacting FSPT systems with both crystalline and internal symmetries."}

In what we call the strong coupling phase, the theory behaves like conventional quantum mechanics, instantons are real, and tunneling is not suppressed. In the weak coupling phase, the instantons responsible for tunneling become complex, and tunneling suppression takes place at the so-called Toda lattice points.

Contrary to the density of states (DOS) calculations in the literature, the experimentally measured $ρ(T)$ in both compounds exhibits semiconducting-like behavior, which we attribute to the strong structural disorder due to its unique crystal structure and low carrier-density. A detailed analysis of the electrical resistivity data reveals that neither the Arrhenius thermal activation law nor variable-range hopping (VRH) models can adequately describe their temperature dependence over the broad temperature range of 2-350 K.

We identify two dominant contributions to nonreciprocal transport: edge flux pinning, which governs the low-field and in-plane field regimes via surface-barrier asymmetry, and bulk flux pinning, which drives the high-field response and correlates directly with the geometric asymmetry of the antidots. Supported by time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations and an analytical model, we provide a unified description of these regimes, linking the diode efficiency to the specific pinning landscape.

Using a non-perturbative Unitary Renormalization Group (URG) approach, we derive coupled renormalization-group flow equations for the Kondo exchange and the local field, and obtain a field-dependent RG phase diagram. The RG flows separate a low-energy Kondo-screened phase, where the impurity is absorbed into the Fermi sea and forms an entangled singlet with the conduction bath, from a polarized local-moment phase in which screening is frustrated and impurity-bath entanglement is suppressed. We identify the fixed-point Hamiltonians governing the two phases and the critical regime, and relate the transition to the emergence of a novel non-Fermi liquid.

Motivated by recent works showing that complex small-scale spatial structures often lead to Brownian dispersion, we study if this principle persists when the driving noise exhibits heavy-tailed jump statistics. Our numerical results show a clear dichotomy linked with the tail behaviour of the noise. When considering standard $α$-stable processes, very large jumps survive the interaction with the spatial complexity and yield anomalous, super-diffusive transport. In contrast, when the $α$-stable noise is either truncated or exponentially tempered, suppressing extremely long jumps, the transport undergoes a transition to a classical diffusive regime."}

In FeSe, symmetry-breaking perturbations serve as highly sensitive probes of these couplings.

In this study, uniaxial strain is employed as a tunable symmetry-breaking control parameter to probe the intrinsic lattice response in the absence of disorder. The temperature evolution of phonon excitations was examined with fine temperature resolution in the vicinity of the nemato-structural transition temperature $T_s$, under strain applied along the $\\langle 110 \\rangle$ and $\\langle 100 \\rangle$ crystallographic directions. A subtle asymmetry of the $A_{1g}^{ph}$ mode appears in the unstrained crystal within a narrow temperature window around $T_s$, originating from the emergence of an additional mode in the fully symmetric channel. With applied strain, this feature becomes more distinctly resolved. The anomaly is attributed to modifications of the coupling between lattice and electronic degrees of freedom driven by the ordering fluctuations right above the nematic transition. These fluctuations enhance susceptibility for phonon-electron-phonon coupling in the vicinity of the X and R points of the Brillouin zone and promote two-phonon scattering close to the $A_{1g}^{ph}$ mode. The presence of this two-phonon scattering depends on both the strength and the direction of the applied strain, indicating a high sensitivity of FeSe to local symmetry breaking."}

We also show that the effect of flexomagnetism and microstructure can lead to some interesting phenomena in wave propagation, which are not observed in classical linear elasticity theory of waves. Specifically, in contrast to classical linear elastic materials, where wave propagation is non-dispersive, flexomagnetic materials with microstructure can exhibit both normal and abnormal dispersion. It is also noteworthy that, in flexomagnetic materials with gradient elasticity, the phase velocities of transverse waves can exceed those of longitudinal waves, which is atypical in classical elasticity. Furthermore, waves can also attenuate for a certain range of wavenumbers that depend on the flexomagnetic coefficient and microstructural parameters. Finally, we explore the possibility of waves exhibiting zero group velocity modes, where waves are non-propagating but have strong local energy confinement, negative group velocity modes, where the wave packet moves in the opposite direction to that of wave propagation, and the phenomenon of wave freezing, where a propagating wave stops in space without diffusing or spreading."}

Although altermagnets carry no net magnetization, the momentum dependent spin splitting, combined with RSOC, enables a pronounced spin valve effect without ferromagnetic electrodes. We show that conductance, spin polarization, and TMR exhibit distinct and robust fingerprints of the triplet pairing symmetry.

In this Letter, we show that the singularity is not the definition of criticality but its asymptotic outcome: criticality is already written in the microcanonical entropy derivatives at any finite size as intrinsic morphological structures -- inflection points and extrema. The singularity is then the endpoint of a sharpening process that evolves with increasing system size. Combining microcanonical inflection-point analysis (MIPA) with the Berlin-Kac spherical model -- for which the microcanonical density of states is known in closed form at every finite $N$ -- we systematically identify these structures in the energy profiles of entropy derivatives that encode the transition. An inflection point in the inverse temperature $β_N(ε)=\\partial_εS_N$ and a pronounced peak in its derivative $γ_N(ε)=\\partial^2_εS_N$ define a well-controlled pseudocritical trajectory whose controlled sharpening and drift culminate in the macroscopic cusp at the critical energy $ε_c$ in the thermodynamic limit.

In the ground state, the quasiparticle spectral weight $Z_{\\mathbf{k}}$ peaks at momenta $\\mathbf{k}_0 \\equiv (\\pm\\fracπ{2},\\pm\\fracπ{2})$. The total-energy dispersion versus $\\mathbf{k}$ agrees remarkably well with the Green function Monte Carlo results. However, Landau's one-to-one correspondence hypothesis for quasiparticles breaks down here with the incoherent component exhibiting intrinsic magnetization originating from a minimal $2\\times2$ loop current that forms a $4\\times4$ pattern on the square lattice--a finding in excellent agreement with density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations. In the two-hole ground state, a new pairing mechanism is revealed: the two holes are automatically fused into a tightly bound object consisting of an incoherent $d_{xy}$ pairing along the diagonal direction by compensating the local loop currents. This hole pair is again a ``cat state'' that resonates strongly between the incoherent $d_{xy}$ and a coherent $d_{x^2-y^2}$ Cooper channel to gain substantial hopping energy. Its size extends over an area of about $4\\times 4$ lattice spacings, much smaller than the divergent AFM correlation length, implying that it should survive as a minimal superconducting building block even in the dilute doping regime. Experimental implications and the generalization to the finite-doping case are briefly addressed."}

A quantitative characterization of the resultant field-induced superconducting dynamics with spatio-temporal resolution remains challenging, particularly in two-dimensional materials. In this work, we analyze magnetic noise measured by the depolarization rate of a proximate single spin-qubit as a non-invasive probe of such dynamical fluctuations. We demonstrate that the temperature dependence of the magnetic noise spectrum near $T_c$ deviates from predictions based on quasiparticle excitations due to critical superconducting fluctuations, which in turn are enhanced by a weak applied field. By analyzing the magnetic noise due to vortex dynamics, we further show that noise spectroscopy is not only able to distinguish between different vortex phases, but also extract key physical quantities of interest, such as oscillation frequencies of pinned vortices, phonon dispersion of vortex lattices and vortex diffusivity in a vortex liquid. Complementing recent work on noise magnetometry of quasiparticle excitations and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions in two-dimensional superconductors without an applied field, our work highlights the ability of noise spectroscopy to reveal a wealth of superconducting dynamical phenomena in an applied field."}

Motivated by recent experiments that report ferroelectricity -- and even multiferroicity -- in the prototypical diamagnetic band insulator SrTiO$_3$ induced by terahertz pulses, we investigate the carrier and magnetization dynamics of SrTiO$_3$ excited optically by linearly and circularly polarized light. Our real-time time-dependent density-functional theory (RT-TDDFT) results reveal a highly non-trivial, site- and orbital-dependent temporal evolution with charge transferred from O $2p$ to Ti $3d$ states. For linearly polarized light the orbitally polarized lobes of electron density at the oxygen and titanium sites fluctuate out-of-phase, resembling the soft transverse optical phonon mode, dynamically breaking inversion symmetry. In contrast, circularly polarized pulses induce a coherent rotation of the charge dipoles around O. This induces a helicity-dependent finite transient magnetization with opposite sign for oxygen and Ti even without ionic motion. Detailed analysis reveals that the dominant mechanism is the transfer of angular momentum of light to the electronic orbital angular momentum, while spin-orbit coupling plays a key role in the transfer from orbital to spin angular momentum, the former being an order of magnitude larger than the latter."}

Chemical engineering strategies, such as doping and solid-solution mixing, are therefore widely employed to fine-tune the electronic and optical properties of semiconductors. Predicting the impact of such modifications, however, remains highly challenging due to the intrinsic complexity of chemically disordered and anharmonic systems, as well as the computational limitations of conventional first-principles approaches. In this work, we introduce a new computational framework that combines ab initio electronic-structure methods with machine-learning techniques to achieve first-principles precision in the prediction of optoelectronic properties of anharmonic solid solutions at finite temperature.

In this study, uniaxial strain is employed as a tunable symmetry-breaking control parameter to probe the intrinsic lattice response in the absence of disorder. The temperature evolution of phonon excitations was examined with fine temperature resolution in the vicinity of the nemato-structural transition temperature $T_s$, under strain applied along the $\\langle 110 \\rangle$ and $\\langle 100 \\rangle$ crystallographic directions. A subtle asymmetry of the $A_{1g}^{ph}$ mode appears in the unstrained crystal within a narrow temperature window around $T_s$, originating from the emergence of an additional mode in the fully symmetric channel. With applied strain, this feature becomes more distinctly resolved. The anomaly is attributed to modifications of the coupling between lattice and electronic degrees of freedom driven by the ordering fluctuations right above the nematic transition. These fluctuations enhance susceptibility for phonon-electron-phonon coupling in the vicinity of the X and R points of the Brillouin zone and promote two-phonon scattering close to the $A_{1g}^{ph}$ mode.

Upon doping, a pseudogap (PG) phase emerges - marked by selective gapping of the Fermi surface without conventional symmetry breaking in spin or charge channels. A key challenge is understanding how quasiparticle breakdown in the Fermi liquid gives rise to this enigmatic state, and how it connects to both the Mott insulating and superconducting phases. Here, we develop a renormalization-based construction of strongly correlated lattice models that captures the emergence of the pseudogap phase and its transition to a Mott insulator. Applying a many-body tiling scheme to the fixed-point impurity model uncovers a lattice model with electron interactions and Kondo physics. At half-filling, the interplay between Kondo screening and bath charge fluctuations in the impurity model leads to Fermi liquid breakdown. This reveals a pseudogap phase characterized by a non-Fermi liquid (the Mott metal) residing on nodal arcs, gapped antinodal regions of the Fermi surface, and an anomalous scaling of the electronic scattering rate with frequency. The eventual confinement of holon-doublon excitations of this exotic metal obtains a continuous transition into the Mott insulator. Our results identify the pseudogap as a distinct long-range entangled quantum phase, and offer a new route to Mott criticality beyond the paradigm of local quantum criticality."}

Potter"], "title": "Collective Phonon Mixing and Eigenvector Transport Under Isotope Substitution", "comment": null, "summary": "Isotopic substitution modifies nuclear masses without altering the electronic potential energy surface to first order and is therefore often interpreted as a simple rescaling of vibrational frequencies. In solids with dense phonon manifolds, however, mass substitution acts as a parametric Hermitian deformation of the mass-weighted dynamical matrix, generating a continuous family of eigenproblems whose eigenvectors can undergo substantial rotation within coupled subspaces. Here we investigate protiated and deuterated ZIF-8 using inelastic neutron scattering and density functional theory lattice-dynamics calculations. While many vibrational modes exhibit near-ideal mass scaling and preserve their character across isotopic endpoints, modes embedded in spectrally congested regions display pronounced redistribution of vibrational character that cannot be inferred from frequency shifts alone. Because inelastic neutron scattering intensity is directly weighted by hydrogen displacement amplitude, spectral sparsity and congestion provide experimental indicators of predictable frequency renormalisation or susceptibility to qualitative eigenvector reorganisation under deuteration. To establish physically meaningful mode correspondence, we develop an adiabatic eigenvector-continuation framework with overlap-based tracking and explicit stability diagnostics. These results show that vibrational identity in complex framework materials is best understood as a continuous trajectory in eigenvector space and provide a general framework for analysing isotope-induced spectral flow in dense phonon systems."}

By exploiting a quantum equivalence called \\emph{mirror symmetry}, these models are mapped to tractable mirror models (also elliptic), in which topological protection is provided by more familiar winding numbers. Phase diagrams and scaling properties of elliptic models are compared to some of the experimental and numerical data accumulated over the past three decades. The geometry of scaling flows extracted from quantum Hall experiments is in good agreement with modular predictions, including the location of many quantum critical points. One conspicuous model %(arguably the simplest and most natural one) has a critical delocalization exponent $ν_{\\rm tor} = 18 \\ln 2 /(π^2 G^4) = 2.6051\\dots$ ($G$ is Gauss' constant) that is in excellent agreement with the value $ν_{\\rm num} = 2.607\\pm\\,.004$ calculated in the numerical Chalker-Coddington model, suggesting that these models are in the same universality class. The real delocalization exponent may be disentangled from other scaling exponents in finite size scaling experiments, giving an experimental value $ν_{\\rm exp} = 2.3\\pm 0.2$. The modular model suggests how these theoretical and experimental results may be reconciled, but in order to determine if these theoretical models really are in the quantum Hall universality class, improved finite size scaling experiments are urgently needed."}

It has emerged as a promising platform for engineering 2D magnetism because its intertwined electronic, optical, and magnetic properties can be profoundly modified via external stimuli such as electrical gating or magnetic fields. However, other strategies for tuning magnetism in layered materials, such as molecular intercalation, remain largely unexplored for CrSBr. Here, we demonstrate that the intercalation of tetramethylammonium (TMA) and tetrapropylammonium (TPA) ions into CrSBr induces a transition from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic order, while significantly enhancing the magnetic transition temperature to 190 K (TMA) and 230 K (TPA). The resulting intercalates are air-stable and exhibit large, hysteretic magnetoresistance exceeding 60% at 50 K in the TPA case. Besides, intercalation introduces symmetry-breaking structural changes in each CrSBr plane, revealed by Raman microscopy and corroborated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. These findings highlight molecular intercalation as a powerful and versatile route to tailor the magnetic properties of CrSBr and unlock its potential to fabricate robust, high-temperature 2D magnetic devices."}

Benchmarking with X-ray pair distribution function data, and with the more computationally demanding simulations of X-ray absorption near-edge spectra (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), demonstrate that ActiveStructOpt reliably determines structures that match closely in spectra across diverse materials classes. Under equivalent computational budgets, ActiveStructOpt outperforms existing structure determination methods.

Here, we present the engineering of selective room-temperature chemical sensors, comprising highly porous tin dioxide (SnO2) - graphene oxide (GO) nano-heterojunction layouts. The optoelectronic and chemical properties of these highly porous (above 90%) p-n heterojunctions were systematically investigated in terms of composition and morphologies. Optimized SnO2-GO layouts demonstrate significant potential as both visible-blind photodetectors and as selective room-temperature chemical sensors. Notably, a low GO content results in an excellent UV light responsivity (400A x W-1), with short rise and decay times, and room-temperature high chemical sensitivity with selective detection of volatile organic compounds such as ethanol down to 100~ppb. In contrast, a high concentration of GO drastically decreases the room-temperature response to ethanol and results in good selectivity to ethylbenzene. The feasibility of tuning the chemical selectivity of the sensor response by engineering the relative amount of GO and SnO2 is a promising feature that may guide the future development of miniaturized solid-state gas sensors. Furthermore, the excellent optoelectronic properties of these SnO2-GO nano-heterojunctions may find applications in various other areas such as optoelectronic devices and (photo)electrocatalysis."}

The primary focus is on response tensors; however, the program can also describe equilibrium properties and other physical properties, such as magnetic interactions. The program can describe the symmetry using the conventional magnetic space groups, as well as using the spin groups that describe the non-relativistic limit. Additional functionality includes the treatment of quantities projected onto a particular site and expansions in the magnetic order parameter.

Thin films fabricated by physical vapor deposition were irradiated with 6.6 MeV Cu +3 ions up to 25 DPA, while TGS continuously monitored the evolution of surface acoustic wave (SAW) frequency and thermal diffusivity. Post-irradiation transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to quantify void formation as a metric of accumulated radiation damage. A pronounced decrease in SAW frequency was observed some seconds after the onset of irradiation, and it was found to correlate strongly with the final void density. Vacancy MEB calculations propose that the small decrease in SAW frequency is associated with the low population of mobile vacancies, promoting defect recombination and decreasing void formation. This relationship enables early prediction of relative radiation damage resistance within minutes of irradiation, substantially reducing the time required compared to conventional irradiation and postcharacterization routes, allowing rapid screening of multiple compositions. We were able to test this method with 3 compositions of the Cu-Cr-Ta system. More generally, this in situ approach provides an efficient pathway for accelerating the development of materials for radiation environments."}

Here, we investigate the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity, $ρ(T)$, in nonmagnetic single crystals of the Remeika-phase cage compounds R$_3$Co$_4$Ge$_{13}$ (R = Y, Lu). Contrary to the density of states (DOS) calculations in the literature, the experimentally measured $ρ(T)$ in both compounds exhibits semiconducting-like behavior, which we attribute to the strong structural disorder due to its unique crystal structure and low carrier-density. A detailed analysis of the electrical resistivity data reveals that neither the Arrhenius thermal activation law nor variable-range hopping (VRH) models can adequately describe their temperature dependence over the broad temperature range of 2-350 K. However, a model incorporating parallel conduction through both semiconducting and metallic channels provides an adequate explanation. In addition to a dominant metallic conduction below $\\sim 10$~K, a negative temperature coefficient of the electrical resistivity ($dρ/dT$) is found in both samples. In the absence of magnetic impurities, the observed $dρ/dT < 0$ is interpreted in terms of the structural Kondo mechanism."}

Taking the example of one of the widely investigated altermagnets, CrSb, we explore the underlying mechanisms leading to the formation or breaking of altermagnetism. With the aid of DFT calculation and symmetry analysis, we study the behavior of MSSP in the altermagnetic bands of pristine CrSb, along with a few model structures designed from the pristine one by hypothetical vacancy engineering and interstitial doping. We show that the six-fold rotational symmetry of the pristine CrSb can be reduced to a two-fold rotational symmetry via vacancy and doping engineering. We discover the formation of fragmented nodal curves (FNCs) across the Brillouin zone when in an altermagnetic material when the symmetry is restricted to two-fold rotation. Unlike the typical nodal planes and axes, the location of the FNCs in the momentum space is found to be band-specific. The formation of FNCs is further validated by introducing uniaxial strain to CrSb and by examining the band structure of RbMnPO$_4$, as they both exhibit a two-fold rotational symmetry responsible for altermagnetism. We observe that, unlike the pristine case, these FNCs have the potential to manifest anomalous Hall conductivities (AHC), while the Néel vector orients along both in-plane and out-of-plane directions. This flexibility of the AHC will pave the way for the application of altermagnets in the futuristic quantum devices."}

To contribute to addressing this global issue, we investigated the spin-labeling capabilities of aqueous chlorine dioxide (ClO$_2$) radicals upon introduction into poly(ethylene terephthalate) and utilized electron spin resonance spectroscopy for detection. The technique is capable of identifying plastic species as the unpaired electron of the radical molecule is strongly sensitive to its local environment through its coupling parameters. Temperature-dependent measurements revealed that the molecules are immobilized at low temperatures and exhibit well-resolved anisotropic and hyperfine spectra that are quantitatively described by a model spin Hamiltonian. Even above the melting point of water, some degrees of freedom remain blocked as a result of the polymer matrix. Furthermore, employing a time-series measurement at room temperature enabled us to determine the diffusion coefficient of the molecule in the polymer."}
