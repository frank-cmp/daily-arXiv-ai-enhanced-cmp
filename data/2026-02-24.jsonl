This fact allows one to introduce the adiabatic invariant for such a system according to the general definition as a quantity that remains approximately constant in a system with several slowly time-varying parameters. In this paper, we show that, introduced in such a way, the adiabatic invariant can be calculated as the ratio of localized mode energy and its frequency. This yields a dramatically simplified way to solve a class of problems concerning localized oscillation of continuum systems with discrete inclusions, although it is not always clear enough what \"the mode energy\" is. The observed fact allows one to consider newly introduced adiabatic invariants as a straightforward generalization of a notion known to Hamiltonian systems."}

We investigate the scaling of $Δ$ with system size $N$ for two paradigmatic quantum spin-glass models: the two-dimensional Edwards-Anderson (2D-EA) and the all-to-all Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) models. Utilizing a newly proposed unbiased energy-gap estimator for continuous-time projection quantum Monte Carlo simulations, complemented by high-performance sparse eigenvalue solvers, we characterize the gap distributions across disorder realizations. It is found that, in the 2D-EA case, the inverse-gap distribution develops a fat tail with infinite variance as $N$ increases. This indicates that the unfavorable super-algebraic scaling of $Δ$, recently reported for binary couplings [Nature 631, 749 (2024)], persists for the Gaussian disorder considered here, pointing to a universal feature of 2D spin glasses. Conversely, the SK model retains a finite-variance distribution, with the disorder-averaged gap following a rather slow power law, close to $Δ\\propto N^{-1/3}$. This finding provides a promising outlook for the potential efficiency of quantum annealers for optimization problems with dense connectivity."}

Typically, the imaginary-time Green's function is generated by Monte Carlo methods. As the one-point fermionic kernel diverges exponentially for large frequencies, numerical noise generically causes instabilities. We use a convolutional neural network to obtain the spectral density for a given imaginary time Green's function. The network is trained by data which we generate using random Gaussians. We improve the training data set available by including collision centers for the Gaussians rather than employing uniformly distributed Gaussians. Our network is constructed in such a way that its output fulfills positive semidefiniteness. We compare the results of our network with results of the Maximum Entropy method (MaxEnt), a standard method for the same reconstruction problem for the spectral density. This comparison is performed for three different cases, namely our Gaussian based test data as well as two physical models, the 1d Hubbard model showing spin-charge separation, and the two-dimensional SSH model in the self-consistent Born approximation. We find that the network outperforms MaxEnt when presented data close to the training set. For the physical models considered, MaxEnt recognizes physical features more precisely as compared to our network prediction.

While intralayer exchange interaction favors AM ordering in a single ILL layer across the entire family, the relatively weak interlayer coupling in most cases favors Kramers-degenerate antiferromagnetic order with a doubled magnetic unit cell. This means that most stoichiometric bulk materials, including the previously proposed candidate KV2Se2O, are not altermagnetic, with CsV2Te2O being the only exception.

The chiral anomaly refers to non-equilibrium charge transfer within a Weyl-node pair of opposite chirality under the condition of aligned electric and magnetic fields ($\\bf{E} \\parallel \\bf{B}$), leading to non-conserved chiral charges and thus enhanced electrical conductivity. In experiments, such an enhanced conductivity due to the chiral anomaly manifests as a negative longitudinal magnetoresistance (MR) when the external field $\\bf{H}$ is applied along the bias current direction $\\bf{I}$. In this work, we present rigorous $φ$- and $α$-dependent magnetotransport measurements to investigate such a negative longitudinal MR due to the chiral anomaly in a sunbeam-shaped device fabricated from an untwinned Weyl metal SrRuO$_{3}$ (SRO) thin film. Here, $φ$($α$) represents the angle between $\\bf{I}$ and the in-plane $\\bf{H}$(SRO monoclinic [001]$_{\\rm o}$). Unusual $φ$ dependences of in-plane MR and Hall effects were uncovered at low temperatures, accompanied by the emergence of the fourfold-symmetric component in the in-plane MR. These results indicate that the chiral anomaly and resistivity anisotropy in SRO play important roles. In particular, the dramatic variation of Weyl nodes near the Fermi level through magnetic field manipulation of the magnetization orientation, as revealed by band structure calculations, is consistent with the observed in-plane MR and Hall effect."}

While the field of view of most STM setups extends up to a few microns, obtaining atomic resolution over these large areas is often impractical and excessively time-consuming. This is due to the need to acquire maps with a point number reaching 107 or more with a full current or conductance vs voltage curve at each point. The standard procedure is to make large scale maps and then select small regions to zoom-in for high-resolution atomic scale analysis. However, this approach fails to address a question which is often critical: Does a specific atomic-scale modulation of the electronic density of states persist over much larger, mesoscopic length scales? Here we present a new method: Replica STM (R-STM), that overcomes this limitation, allowing the study of atomic-scale phenomena up to micron length scales. We obtained new large-area STM tunneling conductance maps in UTe2 and FeSe, spanning areas over 200 nm in size. In these large scale maps we discovered signals with wavelengths significantly exceeding interatomic distances. We show that these large-wavelength signals are replicas of the underlying atomic-scale density of states modulations. R-STM leverages these replica signals to efficiently track atomic-scale features over large areas. Using this novel technique, we show that the pair density modulation discovered recently in FeSe persists with the same characteristic wavelength up to hundreds of nm length scales. R-STM provides a powerful and practical new capability for STM to compare atomic scale with micrometer scale phenomena. The proof of principle of R-STM can be extended to any other scanning probe microscopy experiment where a periodic signal is traced as a function of position."}

Neutron diffraction reveals moments in the $ab$ plane, while inelastic neutron scattering and susceptibility establish a magnetic easy axis along $c$ in the paramagnetic regime, highlighting a clear inversion between single-ion and ordered-state anisotropies.

Here, we use scanning superconducting interference device (SQUID) susceptometry to directly image the local diamagnetic response in functional S-S'-S TES structures. We resolve long range proximity coupling extending over tens of micrometers, revealing that the local transition temperature is dramatically tuned by neighboring regions, being either enhanced by superconducting (S) leads or suppressed by normal metal (N) contacts.

Probing these nonequilibrium processes requires access to the thermodynamic limit, where the number of lattice sites becomes arbitrarily large, but conventional solvers are constrained to small systems due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space. Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs), originally developed for solving partial differential equations, naturally accommodate inputs of varying resolution and are capable of capturing nonlocal effects. Here, we employ FNOs to learn the mapping from noise-perturbed ground-state momentum distributions to their post-pulse counterparts across a range of interaction strengths and driving parameters. Trained only on small lattices, the model generalizes zero-shot to much larger systems, producing physically reasonable momentum distributions well beyond the reach of numerical solvers. Specifically, the model can predict momentum distribution for a 1024x1024 system within a few seconds that matches the theoretical behavior of key observables, whereas direct numerical simulations have so far been restricted to edge sizes of ~30. These results demonstrate the potential of neural operators to directly access large-scale nonequilibrium dynamics, providing a new pathway toward the thermodynamic limit in strongly correlated materials."}

The curvature decomposes into chiral sectors, and effective tetrads are introduced using components of the higher-dimensional connection.

The six-dimensional theory yields two overlapping four-dimensional Lorentzian sectors of opposite signature, related via gluing constraints across their intersection.

While the field of view of most STM setups extends up to a few microns, obtaining atomic resolution over these large areas is often impractical and excessively time-consuming. This is due to the need to acquire maps with a point number reaching 107 or more with a full current or conductance vs voltage curve at each point. The standard procedure is to make large scale maps and then select small regions to zoom-in for high-resolution atomic scale analysis. However, this approach fails to address a question which is often critical: Does a specific atomic-scale modulation of the electronic density of states persist over much larger, mesoscopic length scales? Here we present a new method: Replica STM (R-STM), that overcomes this limitation, allowing the study of atomic-scale phenomena up to micron length scales. We obtained new large-area STM tunneling conductance maps in UTe2 and FeSe, spanning areas over 200 nm in size. In these large scale maps we discovered signals with wavelengths significantly exceeding interatomic distances. We show that these large-wavelength signals are replicas of the underlying atomic-scale density of states modulations. R-STM leverages these replica signals to efficiently track atomic-scale features over large areas. Using this novel technique, we show that the pair density modulation discovered recently in FeSe persists with the same characteristic wavelength up to hundreds of nm length scales. R-STM provides a powerful and practical new capability for STM to compare atomic scale with micrometer scale phenomena. The proof of principle of R-STM can be extended to any other scanning probe microscopy experiment where a periodic signal is traced as a function of position."}

We introduce a physics-informed Bayesian Active Learning (BAL) framework that autonomously tunes precursor pulse times by integrating a Langmuir adsorption model directly into the Gaussian Process (GP) kernel. A key innovation is a two-stage parameter estimation strategy that decouples noise filtering from physical parameter extraction: the GP first smooths noisy data through standard prediction, then Langmuir parameters are fitted to the noise-filtered GP predictions. This approach effectively separates signal from experimental noise. We evaluate the framework against a standard data-driven GP across four simulated regimes, demonstrating convergence within five iterations, up to fourfold improvement in prediction accuracy, and two to fourfold reduction in precursor usage. Experimental validation using TiO2 deposition via Tetrakisdimethylamido Titanium (TDMAT) and ozone confirms that the physics-informed model accurately identifies saturation times for high-coverage targets ($\\geq$95\\%), with observed deviations at lower saturation levels providing valuable insight into non-ideal desorption behaviors."}

In HD-DMFT, the continuous hybridization function is approximated by a finite set of bath-site energies and hybridization amplitudes, determined by minimizing a highly non-convex multivariable cost function. As the number of bath sites increases, the optimization becomes more sensitive to the initial guess and more prone to suboptimal local minima, which can slow or destabilize the DMFT self-consistency loop. We reformulate bath fitting as a supervised regression problem and train a kernel ridge regression model to predict near-optimal discrete bath parameters directly from the target hybridization function on the Matsubara axis. To ensure physical relevance and data diversity, we construct the training dataset from tight-binding Hamiltonians of layered-perovskite-like ruthenate models across systematically deformed structures, instead of relying on naive random parameter sampling, and obtain high-quality labels through fully converged conventional bath fitting. Time-reversal symmetry is explicitly incorporated in both feature and target representations to reduce effective dimensionality and enforce physical consistency. Benchmarks in the non-interacting limit show that the learned initialization systematically reduces the initial fitting error, decreases the number of conjugate-gradient iterations, and improves robustness against local minima over a wide range of bath sizes.

The most intriguing example of such a phase is light-induced superconductivity (SC) in non-superconducting materials. However, realizing unconventional SC at commensurate half-filling remains a formidable challenge even in non-equilibrium, as the regime is typically dominated by the robust stability of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) Mott insulating (MI) state. Here, we provide a novel non-equilibrium route to realize unconventional d-wave SC in a half-filled system through Floquet engineering. We analyze the periodically driven Fermi-Hubbard model on a bipartite lattice and demonstrate that a high-frequency drive can transform a weakly interacting insulator into a regime of strong correlations by the drive-induced renormalization of nearest-neighbor hopping. Furthermore, the drive induces staggered higher range hoppings that can frustrate the AFM order while simultaneously generate staggered potential that lifts the kinetic constraints inherent to the half-filled system, fostering the charge dynamics required to stabilize d-wave pairing against the competing AFM state. The resulting SC phase is protected by high-frequency prethermalization, maintaining stability over timescales exponentially large in the drive frequency. This protocol circumvents the need for chemical doping, offering a 'disorder-free' alternative for realizing unconventional pairing with direct applications in optimizing the performance of superconducting quantum computers, qubit arrays and other upcoming quantum technologies."}

Using ReaxFF-based reactive molecular dynamics (RMD) simulations with extensive statistical validation, we performed temperature-ramp MD simulations of pristine and functionalized N-carbophenes. We demonstrate that N-carbophenes remain stable up to temperatures above 1000 K. The phase-change onset temperatures decrease as the N-phenylene chain length increases in pristine N-carbophenes, attributed to increasing antiaromaticity in the central phenylene segments, thereby contributing to the foundational understanding of aromatic versus antiaromatic bonding in 2D carbon networks, a topic of considerable interest in theoretical chemistry. Pristine N-carbophenes exhibit negative area thermal expansion (NATE), whereas functional groups modulate this, leading to either negative or positive expansion. Functional groups remain stably bonded well above the transition temperature. We also show that a temperature-induced phase transition from graphenylene (2-carbophene) to γ-graphyne is possible. Our results provide upper bounds on N-carbophene stability, clarify the relationships between structure and thermal properties, and identify a new transformation pathway.

We improve on conventional mean-field theory by utilizing a renormalization group framework that captures high-energy fluctuations. This method generates effective magnetic and $d$-wave pairing interactions, and allows for an unbiased exploration of coexisting phases at weak and moderate interaction strengths. Unrestricted mean-field calculations of the effective Hamiltonian on large finite lattices are combined with analyses in the thermodynamic limit, revealing a rich phase diagram with extensive regions of coexisting orders. We find that $d$-wave superconductivity coexists with Néel order on the electron-doped side. On the hole-doped side, superconductivity is found to coexist with spiral or stripe magnetic orders. Within the stripe ordered region, the superconducting order parameter is spatially modulated, with a period that follows the charge modulation of the stripes. Below van Hove filling, pairing provides the primary energy gain, while the stripe order yields only a small, and hence fragile, additional energy lowering."}

Conventional frequency-domain thermoreflectance (FDTR) techniques, while proficient at evaluating cross-plane thermal conductivity, suffer from restricted capability in resolving in-plane transport due to inherent phase-delay constraints and inadequate lateral resolution. In this investigation, we establish a non-contact beam-offset FDTR (BO-FDTR) approach that concurrently determines both directional thermal conductivities within layered semiconductor architectures. Our methodology implements spatial separation between excitation and detection beams while utilizing coupled normalized amplitude and phase responses as analytical inputs, thereby improving discrimination between anisotropic thermal parameters. We combine this experimental configuration with a Bayesian optimization scheme incorporating Gaussian Process Regression (BO-GPR) to reduce estimation inaccuracies, attaining measurement uncertainties under 1% to 2% at 95% confidence intervals. This technique demonstrates particular efficacy for intricate multilayer nanostructures, furnishing a structured protocol for superlattice thermal evaluation. Experimental characterization of an AlAs/GaAs superlattice (period thickness 52 nm) delivers thermal conductivity values of 14.7 W m-1 K-1 (cross-plane) and 37.4 W m-1 K-1 (in-plane). Our findings indicate that integrating frequency sweeps with varied beam offset locations yields superior measurement precision, exceeding conventional single-variable methods and confirming thermal assessment validity across both geometric arrangements."}

However, L-PBF alloys often display much lower fracture toughness, in some cases up to 70% below conventionally wrought counterparts. The reasons for this toughness paradox have remained elusive, since conventional tools cannot directly visualize sub-surface microscale deformation processes that govern crack growth. Here we apply scanning 3D X-ray diffraction and phase contrast tomography to simultaneously capture microstructural evolution with 1 micron resolution near an advancing crack tip, utilizing 316L stainless steel as a model system. We demonstrate that the toughness paradox is not solely a consequence of extrinsic processing defects or residual stresses, but rather an intrinsic failure to relax crack-tip stresses via plasticity. While wrought material facilitates stable crack-tip blunting through localized dislocation accumulation, the L-PBF material undergoes premature work-hardening saturation that triggers extreme stress partitioning and high stress triaxiality. This results in a transition from ductile blunting to a sharp, unstable fracture mode. These findings identify work-hardening exhaustion as a systemic vulnerability inherent to L-PBF microstructures, where the exceptional initial dislocation density required for high yield strength acts as a saturation ceiling for damage tolerance. This work provides a physical basis for adapting damage models to L-PBF metals and challenges the assumption that high tensile ductility guarantees fracture resistance in rapidly solidified components."}

While the field of view of most STM setups extends up to a few microns, obtaining atomic resolution over these large areas is often impractical and excessively time-consuming. This is due to the need to acquire maps with a point number reaching 107 or more with a full current or conductance vs voltage curve at each point. The standard procedure is to make large scale maps and then select small regions to zoom-in for high-resolution atomic scale analysis. However, this approach fails to address a question which is often critical: Does a specific atomic-scale modulation of the electronic density of states persist over much larger, mesoscopic length scales? Here we present a new method: Replica STM (R-STM), that overcomes this limitation, allowing the study of atomic-scale phenomena up to micron length scales. We obtained new large-area STM tunneling conductance maps in UTe2 and FeSe, spanning areas over 200 nm in size. In these large scale maps we discovered signals with wavelengths significantly exceeding interatomic distances. We show that these large-wavelength signals are replicas of the underlying atomic-scale density of states modulations. R-STM leverages these replica signals to efficiently track atomic-scale features over large areas. Using this novel technique, we show that the pair density modulation discovered recently in FeSe persists with the same characteristic wavelength up to hundreds of nm length scales. R-STM provides a powerful and practical new capability for STM to compare atomic scale with micrometer scale phenomena. The proof of principle of R-STM can be extended to any other scanning probe microscopy experiment where a periodic signal is traced as a function of position."}

We uncover a previously unreported chiral ferroelectric phase with space group $R3$, which exhibits a large spontaneous polarization and a low polarization switching barrier, enabling polarization reversal under electric fields. Crucially, the structural chirality of this phase is intrinsically locked to the ferroelectric polarization, allowing electrical control of the chiral handedness.

We use a convolutional neural network to obtain the spectral density for a given imaginary time Green's function. The network is trained by data which we generate using random Gaussians.

This effect enables generating unconventional out-of-plane orbital current with collinear orbital polarization from all 10 spin Laue groups of centrosymmetric altermagnets, which is critical for field-free manipulation of perpendicular magnetization that is a key for next-generation information technology. We reveal perturbative and non-perturbative effects of spin-group symmetry breaking, and unveil that MOT is a much more generic effect of real altermagnets than SST.

These values are significantly lower than those previously reported for the solid solution containing less manganese (Bi$_{95.69}$Mn$_{3.69}$Fe$_{0.62}$), which were 3877\\% and 742\\%, respectively. Analysis of the results indicates that differences in field dependence among the studied materials are associated with varying amounts of magnetic $α$-BiMn. The anomalous magnetoresistance behavior, as compared with that of pure bismuth, is attributed to the influence of internal magnetism on electrical transport within the bismuth matrix of the studied solid solutions."}

Decreasing the temperature from 300K down to 160K leads to a significant modification of the density of states corresponding to the Bi-O hybridized band near the Fermi level (E$_\\text{F}$). This modification indicates reduction of Bi 6$sp$ - O 2$p$ hybridization and O 2$p$ spectral weight near E$_\\text{F}$. The strong decrement of covalency at lower temperatures is accompanied by a decrement in O 2$p$ hole density due to possible charge transfer from Bi 6$s$ to the O 2$p$ band. Bi-charge state analysis from Bi-4$f$ core-level spectra showed that at 300K, $δ$ (charge difference between alternate Bi sites) value in 4$\\pmδ$ is much less than at 160K, which reveals the transition towards the ionic nature of CD or static CD in BBO at low temperature. On the other hand, O 1$s$ core-level spectra displayed an asymmetric shape, and temperature-dependent modifications of the asymmetric shape and intensity have been observed. This highlights the significant influence of the O 2$p$ band hole on the dynamical CD at the Bi site."}

We present a physics-informed pretraining strategy that leverages simple physical potentials which can improve the robustness and stability of graph-based MLIPs for MD simulations. We demonstrate this approach by deploying a pretraining-finetuning pipeline where MLIPs are initially pretrained on data labelled with embedded atom model potentials and subsequently finetuned on the quantum mechanical ground truth data. By evaluating across three diverse material systems (phosphorus, silica, and a subset of Materials Project) and three representative MLIP architectures (CGCNN, M3GNet, and TorchMD-NET), we find that this physics-informed pretraining consistently improves both prediction accuracy as well as stability in MD compared to the baselines."}

While polarization-resolved Raman scattering has been widely used to extract symmetry information of eigenmodes, its conventional geometry suffers from significant limitations: it accesses only a subset of Raman tensor elements, enforces π-periodic intensity patterns that obscure intrinsic crystalline symmetries, and lacks sensitivity to wavevector-dependent anisotropy. To overcome these constraints, here we introduce rotational-anisotropy Raman spectroscopy (RA-Raman). By measuring scattering intensity during full azimuthal rotation of the optical scattering plane at oblique incidence, this geometry enables complete reconstruction of the Raman tensor and reveals rich rotational anisotropy patterns essential for accessing subtle symmetry information elusive to conventional methods. We developed a prototype instrument to validate this approach experimentally. For centrosymmetric crystals, RA-Raman unambiguously identifies phonon symmetry representations and determines crystallographic axes. In noncentrosymmetric crystals, it resolves directional anisotropy and angular dispersion of phonon-polaritons, enabling quantitative determination of the Faust-Henry coefficient and the separation of deformation-potential and electro-optic scattering contributions. By demonstrating unprecedented symmetry-resolving power in standard benchmark crystals, we establish RA-Raman as a powerful tool with far-reaching potential to discover and characterize symmetry-breaking phases and topological excitations in quantum materials."}

While much literature exists detailing corrosion rates and mechanisms of structural materials in liquid metals, much still remains to be discovered in new regimes of temperature, chemistry, and impurity levels. We focus on a less-studied set of conditions, specifically to investigate how liquid lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE) corrodes ferritic/martensitic steels in high-temperature oxidizing conditions. We find that corrosion follows grain boundaries, transitioning from intergranular attack to broader area corrosion as it progresses. Both the Cr and oxygen diffusion play vital roles in this process. Mechanistically speaking, the ingress of LBE induces regions of martensitic decomposition to ferrite via localized Cr depletion, somewhat blunting or slowing the corrosion from occurring. A stable, coherent oxide scale appears to be the deciding factor controlling whether intergranular LBE attack occurs or not. Most surprisingly, a layer of Fe enriched BCC phase forms on the surface of LBE-corroded T91 at these conditions, contradicting previous studies, including our own, which reported oxide-based surface layers."}

In centrosymmetric two-dimensional antiferromagnets, spin-polarized transport is symmetry-forbidden due to the combined space-time inversion ($PT$) symmetry.

The relative twist breaks $[C_2||P]$ and $[E||C_{nz}]$ symmetries, giving rise to momentum-dependent spin polarization with distinct $d$-, $g$-, and $i$-wave altermagnetic patterns across the Brillouin zone. Using symmetry-invariant $k\\cdot p$ modeling, we extract linear spin-splitting coefficients $α^{(1)}$ ranging from 800-1100 meVÅ, comparable to SOC-induced Rashba-Dresselhaus strengths observed in noncentrosymmetric semiconductors. An out-of-plane electric field ($\\mathcal{E}_z$) introduces Zeeman-type band splitting up to 110 meV at 10 MV/cm, while biaxial strain tunes the NRSS magnitude nearly linearly without altering symmetry.

Here, by means of first-principles calculations and symmetry analysis, we demonstrate that twist engineering applied to the recently synthesized metallic van der Waals antiferromagnet Co-doped bilayer Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ (Fe$_2$CoGaTe$_2$) provides a robust platform for altermagnetism.

Upon intercalation of 1ML of Co, the Co lattice is resized to match the Ir-Ir lattice parameter, resulting in a mismatched G/Co/Ir(111) system. The intercalation of further Co layers leads to a relaxation of the Co lattice and a progressive formation of a commensurate G layer lying on top. We show the C 1s line shape and the band structure of G in the two artificial phases, mismatched and commensurate G/Co, through a comparison with the electronic structure of G grown directly on a Co thick film. Our results show that while the G valence band mainly reflects the hybridization with the d states of Co, regardless of the structural phase, the C 1s line shape is very sensitive to the rumpling of the G layer and the coordination of carbon atoms with the underlying Co.

The interplay between exchange interactions and magnetic anisotropy stabilizes long-range ordering of such moments. The compound CuCrP2S6 (CCPS) presents an interesting class of vdW solids where the coupling of Cr3+ moments and ordering of Cu1+ ions give rise to a multiferroic ground state. Here we investigate the spin dynamics of Cr3+ ions in CCPS through magnetization and broadband as well as single sub-THz magnetic resonance measurements. The orbital moment of Cr3+ is quenched under the octahedral crystal field of surrounding chalcogen ions, resulting in negligible magnetic anisotropy-a feature common to Cr-based vdW antiferromagnets (AFM). Resonance spectra over a wide frequency-field-temperature range reveal quasi-2D AFM dynamics governed mainly by isotropic Cr-Cr exchange interactions, which determine the magnetic order, spin reorientation, and damping. Sub-THz resonance spectra also uncover a field-induced ferromagnetic polarization, highlighting the universal role of Cr-Cr exchange in layered Cr compounds. Moreover, persistent magnetic correlations far above the Néel temperature (TN ~ 32 K) points to short-range magnetic order in CCPS and motivates future studies of a possible interplay between AFM and antiferroelectric orders.

To determine the phase stability, we previously developed a procedure to compute the harmonic free energy as a function of temperature, which was suited for CsPbI$_3$ but fails when Cs is replaced by organic cations due to their rotational freedom. Herein we propose a multistep thermodynamic integration (TI) approach that corrects the harmonic free energy to obtain the Gibbs free energy. Given the abundance of local minima in these materials, we employ replica exchange to prevent simulations from getting trapped, while introducing an intermediate potential energy surface to improve convergence and reduce computational cost. Benchmarking energy and forces from different exchange-correlation functionals and dispersion methods against high-level RPA+HF calculations identifies PBE+D3(BJ) as the best trade-off between accuracy, computational efficiency, and precision. To perform molecular dynamics simulations within the TI framework, it was necessary to train a machine learning potential using the MACE architecture on ab initio data calculated with density functional theory. Our results show that, for all three materials, the free energy difference between the $γ$ and $δ$ phases exhibits a very similar temperature dependence. This suggests that phase stability is primarily governed by differences in ground-state energy, rather than by material-specific thermal effects. Beyond these three materials, our methodology provides a robust framework for investigating the phase behavior of other MHPs, paving the way for the discovery of more stable perovskites."}

We uncover a novel brittle-ductile-brittle (BDB) transition: low dislocation densities lead to brittle failure, intermediate densities (~10*14 m-2) enable superior ductility with strains over 20%, and high dislocation densities (~10*15 m-2) induce again brittle fracture. This dislocation density-dependent non-monotonic mechanical response challenges the traditional behavior of ceramics and offers new design opportunities. Furthermore, dislocation densities can monotonically decrease thermal conductivity, revealing a tradeoff between mechanical strength and functionality. The findings reveal a critical threshold of dislocation density in optimizing the performance of functional oxides, and provide a new framework for using dislocations to design advanced materials where mechanical durability and enhanced functionality are intertwined."}

However, its influence on lattice thermal conductivity (kL) remains poorly understood. In the archetypal perovskite SrTiO3, tilting in the low-temperature tetragonal phase is known to enhance kL by suppressing specific phonon scattering channels around 200 cm-1. Here, we investigate the thermal transport in strontium stannate (SrSnO3), another perovskite oxide that undergoes temperature-driven phase transitions, and reveal a completely opposite effect. Through a systematic study across its orthorhombic, tetragonal, and cubic phases, we demonstrate that octahedral tilting in the tetragonal phase of SrSnO3 anomalously triggers acoustic phonon softening. This softening manifests as reduced frequencies and group velocities in low-frequency (<3 THz) acoustic modes, creating a large decrease for heat transport, particularly along the c-axis. Consequently, kL is significantly suppressed, decreasing from 7.48 W m-1 K-1 to 6.06 W m-1 K-1 as the tilting angle increases by a mere 1 degree. These findings identify tilting-induced acoustic softening as a pivotal mechanism for limiting and controlling anisotropic thermal transport in SrSnO3, presenting a stark contrast to the established behavior in SrTiO3."}

Here, we construct a phase diagram of multi-layer square-planar Nd$_{n+1}$Ni$_n$O$_{2n+2}$ compounds and discover signatures of superconductivity for $n$ = 4 - 8. Upon decreasing the dimensionality $n$, the superconducting anisotropy evolves due to 4$f$ electron effects, and electronic structure characteristics approach cuprate-like behavior. Magnetic fluctuations persist from within the superconducting regime and into the over-doped, non-superconducting regime. Remarkably, the superconducting regime overlaps with that of chemically-doped infinite-layer nickelates, demonstrating underlying commonalities and distinct differences across varying structural realizations of square-planar nickelates. Our work establishes this layered template for creating new nickel-based superconductors."}

However, kagome compounds with tunable electrical conductivity remain scarce, which severely impedes their device applications. Here, based on density functional theory (DFT) and Boltzmann transport theory, we introduce the breathing effect into kagome materials $\\mathrm{Nb_3XCl_7}$ (X = F, Cl, Br, I) via chemical precompression, thereby inducing a metal-insulator transition and magnetic variation. We determine that the band structures, optical absorption spectra and magnetic ground states agree well with experimental results at the effective correlation strength $U_{\\text{eff}} = 2$ eV. The calculated conductivity and magnetic properties reveal that the monolayer $\\mathrm{Nb_3Cl_8}$ and $\\mathrm{Nb_3XCl_7}$ undergoes transitions from paramagnetic metals to Mott insulators at $U_{\\text{eff}} = 1$ eV and $t_{\\text{out}}/t_{\\text{in}} = 0.6674$, respectively. Our detailed analysis establishes that the stronger breathing effect corresponds to enhanced chemical precompression, which reduces the region of free electron gas between intercell Nb atoms and facilitates the metal-insulator transition. Finally, we propose several viable synthesis routes for $\\mathrm{Nb_3FCl_7}$, $\\mathrm{Nb_3BrCl_7}$, and $\\mathrm{Nb_3ICl_7}$, providing predictive guidance for experimental studies. Our study establishes a practical framework for investigating the breathing effect in correlated kagome systems and yields valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying metal-insulator transition and magnetic properties in real breathing kagome materials."}

Here we show that Ce$_2$Rh$_3$Ge$_5$ realizes a hard-plane antiferromagnetic state in which partial delocalization of the local moment gives rise to an RKKY exchange that overturns the single-ion easy-axis preference. Neutron diffraction reveals moments in the $ab$ plane, while inelastic neutron scattering and susceptibility establish a magnetic easy axis along $c$ in the paramagnetic regime, highlighting a clear inversion between single-ion and ordered-state anisotropies. In this work, we establish a unified microscopic framework to consistently account for partial $4f$-moment delocalization, enhanced in-plane RKKY exchange, and the resulting hard-plane antiferromagnetic order. Ce$_2$Rh$_3$Ge$_5$ thus provides a benchmark system in which single-ion anisotropy, Kondo screening, and RKKY exchange compete on comparable energy scales, revealing a cooperative route to hard-axis ordering in strongly hybridized Kondo lattices."}

In HD-DMFT, the continuous hybridization function is approximated by a finite set of bath-site energies and hybridization amplitudes, determined by minimizing a highly non-convex multivariable cost function. As the number of bath sites increases, the optimization becomes more sensitive to the initial guess and more prone to suboptimal local minima, which can slow or destabilize the DMFT self-consistency loop. We reformulate bath fitting as a supervised regression problem and train a kernel ridge regression model to predict near-optimal discrete bath parameters directly from the target hybridization function on the Matsubara axis. To ensure physical relevance and data diversity, we construct the training dataset from tight-binding Hamiltonians of layered-perovskite-like ruthenate models across systematically deformed structures, instead of relying on naive random parameter sampling, and obtain high-quality labels through fully converged conventional bath fitting. Time-reversal symmetry is explicitly incorporated in both feature and target representations to reduce effective dimensionality and enforce physical consistency. Benchmarks in the non-interacting limit show that the learned initialization systematically reduces the initial fitting error, decreases the number of conjugate-gradient iterations, and improves robustness against local minima over a wide range of bath sizes. We further demonstrate transferability to interacting DMFT calculations for $\\mathrm{Sr_{2}RuO_{4}}$ solved with an adaptive-truncation impurity solver, where the ML initialization yields consistently faster convergence than a symmetry-preserving heuristic baseline while preserving the final fitted solution."}

Recently, straintronics has proved to be one such external control which can dictate the quantum phases and transitions in materials via the reconstruction of their electronic band structure. A particularly intriguing scenario arises in the context of flat band line-graph lattices wherein straintronics is found to bring forth non trivial phase transitions. This paper reports the phase transitions and thermal scales across the Lieb/Kagome interconversion in the electronic interaction-strain-temperature space. Based on the thermodynamic, spectroscopic and transport signatures across the strain tuned interconversion of these line-graph lattices we have mapped out the low temperature phases and thermal transition scales, numerically determined using non perturbative calculations. While at the low temperatures, interaction-strain plane is spanned by magnetically correlated insulators, flat band induced weak transiently localized insulators and non Fermi liquid metallic phases, thermal fluctuations aid in to stabilize coexistent magnetic correlations. Apart from quantifying the magnetic transition scales in this system our results on the spectroscopic and transport signatures distill the strain tuned metal-insulator transition and crossover scales which exhibit variable transport scaling exponents."}
