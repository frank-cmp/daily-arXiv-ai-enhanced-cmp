Historically explored at the macro- and meso-scale, physical reservoir computing has recently been extended to the atomic scale via chemical mixtures with strong and dynamic heterogeneity. Here we explore the possibility that configurational degeneracy within disordered materials might form the basis for solid-state atomic-scale reservoirs. Our proof-of-concept uses the disordered metal-organic framework DUT-8, which undergoes a series of disorder-disorder transitions on exposure to different guest species. We show that variations in X-ray diffuse scattering associated with these transitions function as suitable readouts for machine learning applications. A combination of nonlinearity and memory effects in the DUT-8 response allows the system to carry out both classification and time-series machine learning tasks with accuracies comparable to those of mesoscale physical reservoir computers. Our results suggest a new avenue for exploiting correlated disorder in solid phases whenever the nature of that disorder can be modulated through external perturbations-a phenomenon we term `responsive disorder'."}

In the center-of-mass frame the dynamics separates into Fourier normal modes. Although suitable couplings can make the system maximally superintegrable (so all bounded motions are periodic), resonance of the mode frequencies does not by itself ensure choreographic motion. We give an explicit criterion for choreographic symmetry of a $T$-periodic solution: invariance under the choreography generator (time shift $T/n$ combined with cyclic relabeling/rotation) holds if and only if every dynamically active Fourier sector satisfies a sectorwise phase condition. This yields a direct test for when a closed orbit can be realized as a single-trace $n$-body choreography. When several symmetry-distinct mode families are simultaneously excited, periodic motions are generically not single-trace; for generic superintegrable initial data the particles lie on distinct closed curves, producing multi-trace motion. In special cases this multi-trace structure organizes into sub-choreographies supported on distinct traces; we refer to this structured splitting as choreographic fragmentation. The cases $n=4,5,6$ are analyzed explicitly. In particular, for $n=6$ the maximally superintegrable resonance $1{:}2{:}3$ yields periodic but generically multi-trace dynamics, whereas a single-trace six-body choreography occurs only at the degenerate resonance $1{:}2{:}2$."}

In this intermediate-coupling region, the effect is related to finite-size free-energy corrections and to the correlations in the Dyson hierarchical spin glass, a model that mimics the physics of finite-dimensional systems. We study this phenomenon in the mean-field approach, both analytically and numerically, and we finally compute the critical exponents for finite-volume corrections in mean-field theory and for the decay of correlations in the Dyson hierarchical model."}

In several families of unconventional superconductors, including transition-metal dichalcogenides and kagome metals, growing evidence points to a cooperative role of EPC and dynamic charge-density fluctuations (CDF) in stabilizing superconductivity. However, how the EPC strength evolves across phase diagrams and relates to superconducting properties in strongly correlated systems remains an open question. Here we investigate the interplay between phonons and the CDF recently identified in cuprate superconductors. Using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, we track the dispersion and intensity of bond-stretching phonons in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-δ}$ over wide ranges of doping, temperature, and momentum. We find that both the phonon softening at the CDF wave vector and the EPC strength, extracted from a pronounced phonon intensity anomaly, are maximized near $p = 0.19$, where superconducting properties are optimal and CDF intensity is strongest. These results identify dynamic charge-density fluctuations, rather than quasi-static charge density waves, as the dominant source of phonon renormalization in cuprates, and establish a direct correlation between EPC strength and the superconducting dome. More broadly, our measurements highlight EPC as a doping-dependent property of correlated materials, shaped by the electronic environment in which lattice vibrations are embedded."}

In the case where at least one of the Hilbert spaces of the bipartition is finite-dimensional, all states are cross states, whereas, in the genuinely infinite-dimensional setting where the dimension of both Hilbert spaces is not finite, the cross states form a trace-norm dense, convex, proper subset of the set of all states. In the latter case, the cross states can be regarded as those physical states that possess a finite amount of entanglement; accordingly, all separable states are of this kind. We prove that, for any Hilbert space dimension, the separable states can be characterized as those cross states that minimize a suitable norm, i.e., the projective norm associated with the projective tensor product of two trace classes; all other cross states are density operators belonging to the projective tensor product space. This is a generalization of the classical cross norm criterion of separability. Finally, we define an extended real-valued entanglement function and study its main properties. Coherently with the interpretation of cross states as finitely entangled states, this function is finite, and coincides with the projective norm, precisely on the cross states of the system."}

By measuring the vortex expulsion field, we estimate the flux saturation number and flux trapping temperature for a range of geometries. We find that many moat designs effectively sequester flux in magnetically shielded environments (< 1 $μ$T), with high-aspect-ratio rectangular \"slit\" moats providing the strongest mitigation at minimal area cost.

Here we present a unified and physically motivated exploration of scaling concepts, emphasizing how invariance under rescaling transformations emerges across systems of increasing dynamical complexity. Rather than adopting a purely abstract approach, we combine simple geometrical constructions, analytical arguments, and prototypical dynamical models to build physical intuition. We begin with elementary, easily reproducible examples governed by a single control parameter, showing how power-law behaviour naturally arises when characteristic scales are absent. We then extend the discussion to nonlinear dynamical systems exhibiting local bifurcations, where two scaling variables control the relaxation toward stationary states. In this context, scaling invariance manifests through critical exponents, crossover phenomena, and critical slowing down, allowing systems of different dimensionality to be grouped into universality classes. Finally, we address continuous phase transitions in chaotic dynamical systems, including transitions from integrability to non-integrability and from bounded to unbounded diffusion. By drawing on concepts traditionally associated with statistical mechanics, such as order parameters, susceptibilities, symmetry breaking, elementary excitations, and topological defects, we show how these transitions can be interpreted within a coherent scaling framework. Taken together, the examples discussed here demonstrate that scaling invariance provides a unifying language for understanding structure, transport, and criticality in nonlinear systems, bridging deterministic dynamics and nonequilibrium statistical physics in a transparent and physically intuitive manner."}

In all geometries with a smooth infrared end-of-space we uncover a robust and universal qualitative feature: Krylov complexity exhibits oscillatory behaviour. The oscillation frequency is controlled by the confinement scale, while the amplitude depends on both the ultraviolet cutoff and the infrared scale. Additional conserved charges modify these patterns without altering their qualitative structure. We further compare our results with the Krylov complexity of the longitudinally perturbed Ising model.

This study presents a hierarchical approach to investigate fracture phenomena in both aligned and randomly oriented nanofibrous networks by integrating atomistic modelling and nonlocal continuum mechanics, namely peridynamics. At the nanoscale, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations are employed to apply tensile loads to freestanding pristine and silver-doped PLA nanofibres, where key mechanical properties such as Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and critical energy release rate are determined. A new method is introduced to transfer data from molecular dynamics to peridynamics by ensuring convergence of the tensile response of a single fiber in both frameworks. This nano-to-micro coupling technique is then used to examine the Young's modulus, fracture toughness in modes I and II, and crack propagation in PLA nanofibrous networks.

Previous studies have shown that for kinetic proofreading networks in the limit of large network size the first-passage time distribution converges either to a delta or to an exponential distribution. Remarkably, these two forms correspond to the two extreme distributions of minimal and maximal entropy for a fixed mean, respectively. Here we build on the connection between first-passage times and graph theory to show that these two limits are not model-specific, but arise generically in Markovian networks from the distribution of the eigenvalues of the generator matrix. A deterministic peak emerges when infinitely many eigenvalues contribute, while the exponential limit arises from a single dominant eigenvalue. We also show that the exponential limit emerges robustly for reversible networks when a backward bias exists. In contrast, the deterministic limit is not obtained from a simple reversal of this condition, but under structurally tighter conditions, revealing a fundamental asymmetry between both regimes. Our theoretical analysis is illustrated and validated by computer simulations of one-step master equations and random networks."}

In particular, it is sign-problem-free when we assume the widely used Millis-Monien-Pines form for the phenomenological susceptibility in the effective action of the fluctuating local moment, even though these local moments are now subjected to Landau damping as a result of their coupling to the itinerant quasiparticle on the fermi surface.

Recent research typically considers problems in which the optimal solution is realized via conservative forces, but whether this situation applies depends on the problem's constraints. In systems with complex topologies like discrete networks, the optimal, dissipation-minimizing protocol involves applying nonconservative forces along cycles if the timescales of the transitions in the network are fixed. We show that although nonconservative driving is optimal in this setting, a conservative protocol exists whose dissipation is at most twice the optimal one. This finding is complemented with an example modeling transport across an energy barrier, which illustrates such improvements of order 1 explicitly. Qualitatively, conservative driving falls short of achieving optimality because direct transport across the barrier is avoided. We conclude with a discussion that the optimality of nonconservative driving might be a generic phenomenon: As fewer degrees of freedom can be optimized, additional degrees of freedom due to adding nonconservative forces become more significant."}

Building upon our previous work that established a mapping from spin systems to QFTs in periodic geometries, we extend the correspondence to systems with boundaries, where boundary conditions play a crucial role in shaping the dynamics. Focusing on Majorana fermions, we derive the allowed boundary conditions from the requirement of inner product conservation and formulate their realization in spin systems. The corresponding spin model is shown to reproduce boundary conditions of QFT accurately when a free function in the spin model is appropriately chosen. As an explicit demonstration, we analyze a flat spacetime example, comparing spectra, mode functions, and linear responses between the continuum and lattice descriptions. Our findings confirm that open spin systems can successfully replicate QFT dynamics with boundaries."}

In several families of unconventional superconductors, including transition-metal dichalcogenides and kagome metals, growing evidence points to a cooperative role of EPC and dynamic charge-density fluctuations (CDF) in stabilizing superconductivity. However, how the EPC strength evolves across phase diagrams and relates to superconducting properties in strongly correlated systems remains an open question. Here we investigate the interplay between phonons and the CDF recently identified in cuprate superconductors. Using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, we track the dispersion and intensity of bond-stretching phonons in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-δ}$ over wide ranges of doping, temperature, and momentum. We find that both the phonon softening at the CDF wave vector and the EPC strength, extracted from a pronounced phonon intensity anomaly, are maximized near $p = 0.19$, where superconducting properties are optimal and CDF intensity is strongest. These results identify dynamic charge-density fluctuations, rather than quasi-static charge density waves, as the dominant source of phonon renormalization in cuprates, and establish a direct correlation between EPC strength and the superconducting dome. More broadly, our measurements highlight EPC as a doping-dependent property of correlated materials, shaped by the electronic environment in which lattice vibrations are embedded."}

Irradiation adds further complications by generating defect clusters and transmutation products that alter both the driving forces and kinetics of grain boundary motion. In this work, we develop a physics-based, multiscale framework that couples crystal plasticity, stochastic cluster dynamics, and discrete grain boundary dynamics to model the co-evolution of plastic deformation, irradiation damage, and grain growth in fusion-grade tungsten polycrystals. The approach enables simulations on realistic microstructures with arbitrary grain size and misorientation distributions, without recourse to mean-field simplifications. The model captures (i) the spatial heterogeneity of dislocation density distribution during hot working; (ii) irradiation-induced defect accumulation under fusion conditions, and (iii) the buildup of chemical and elastic driving forces for grain boundary migration and microstructural evolution. Parametric studies demonstrate the dominant influence that temperature has on thermally activated grain-boundary mobility, a weaker dependence on prior strain, and a pronounced retardation of recrystallization by rhenium segregation arising from neutron transmutation. Under fusion energy irradiation conditions, our framework predicts a substantial reduction of the effective recrystallization temperature relative to unirradiated microstructures, while Re production restores and even elevates this limit. By providing quantitative projections of recrystallization kinetics and in-service recrystallization temperatures, this work establishes a predictive tool for assessing the lifetime and operational envelope of W-based plasma-facing materials under fusion conditions."}

Recent experimental realization of metallenes in the Ångström limit has further intensified interest in this class of 2D materials. However, achieving sub-atomic insight into them demands the most detailed and systematic characterization of their electronic structure. Such understanding is essential for the rational design and exploitation of their properties in plasmonics, catalysis, and quantum optics. Existing electronic-structure studies are either scattered or focus on a few selected systems, and a comprehensive view of their band structures and Fermi surfaces remains missing. Here, we address this gap by studying 45 elemental metallenes in six monolayer lattices (honeycomb, square, hexagonal, and their buckled forms) using density-functional theory. We found that lattice type primarily fixes the shape and radial placement of the Fermi-lines, while out-of-plane buckling introduces controlled modifications: it shortens long straight Fermi-line segments, and occasionally creates, removes, or merges small Fermi-line pockets. The electronic configuration determines which orbital type dominates the Fermi level. We summarized Fermiology using a single score for each element, termed pocketness, derived from four descriptors that combine element properties (symmetry, coordination) with electronic characteristics (dispersion, Fermi-surface topology). This score enables targeted angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) tests, controlled Lifshitz transitions, and provides a predictive basis for transport and device applications."}

We show that the factorisation of one-loop leading singularities of a null Wilson loop's expectation value into a product of tree-level objects is manifest at the level of twistor Wilson loop diagrams, and is a simple consequence of planarity, without appeal to e.g. unitarity on the amplitude side of the duality. We then use the same approach to derive compact formulae for the one-loop leading singularities of correlators of multiple light-like Wilson loop operators in terms of tree-level objects.

We demonstrate that decoupled transfer learning-separating pretrained GNN feature extractors from simple regressors-overcomes this barrier. Pretrained features provide transferable structural knowledge, while simple regressors enable smooth extrapolation by maintaining learned trends beyond training boundaries. Benchmarked on layered intercalation compounds through four rigorous extrapolation scenarios and a temporal Materials Project split, our framework achieves 68% error reduction (RMSE: 0.881 vs. 2.778 eV/atom) versus end-to-end GNNs for extrapolation. Failure analysis reveals extrapolation succeeds for continuous chemical space but fails for discontinuous space, establishing clear design principles.

In this work, we demonstrate that partial substitution of Li+ by Na+ ions in the second coordination sphere of Eu3+ ions in LiYO2 enables a substantial shift of the phase transition temperature, thereby allowing controlled optimization of the thermometric performance. This approach represents a significantly more cost-effective and efficient strategy for tuning the phase transition temperature compared with the previously proposed substitution of Y3+ by other lanthanide ions. Importantly, we show that lowering the transition temperature through Na+ incorporation simultaneously introduces static compositional disorder and local lattice strain. As a consequence, the enthalpy difference between the competing structural phases decreases, and the cooperativity of the lattice distortion is reduced, indicating a gradual weakening of the first-order character of the phase transition. Our results demonstrate that such structural modifications, while effective in shifting the transition temperature, inevitably lead to a reduction in the relative sensitivity of phase-transition-based luminescent thermometers."}

Optical absorption, reduction and oxidation potentials and charge-transport properties are among the key considerations, and these are influenced both by molecular properties and the solid-state packing arrangement, making computational modelling challenging.

Furthermore we perform a series of gas-phase molecular calculations which show a good agreement with literature data and periodic DFT for the optoelectronic properties of the organic molecular crystals studied, showing that gas-phase molecular calculations could be used to screen organic crystals for OWS at a reduced computational cost."}

While sensitive to crystal symmetries and morphology, it is used ubiquitously to determine the growth modes of thin films. However, analysis of RHEED patterns depends on skilled experts and is therefore difficult to incorporate into the growth strategy in real-time. The development of machine learning (ML) processes, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), presents a unique opportunity towards real-time RHEED pattern recognition. In this study, we develop a CNN model that can accurately classify four common and distinct RHEED patterns present in chalcogenide thin film growth. Its reached accuracy reached 94.9% for single run and 91.2% when averaged over 20 seeds. Our network is able to distinguish the nucleation of three common growth modes encountered in epitaxy, namely Volmer Weber, Stransky-Krastanov and Frank-van der Merwe, potentially enabling future automation of substrate temperature and shutter control informed by RHEED data. The network is material-agnostic and distinguishes the VW process with greater than 98% accuracy but is somewhat more limited in its ability to properly classify roughening and the initiation of Stransky-Krastanov growth. Our findings show that ML techniques can be successfully implemented even in cases where there is no detailed knowledge of growth chemistry providing an avenue towards real-time incorporation of ML to control nanostructure nucleation and thin film morphology."}

Our analysis further reveals an intimate coupling between the local magnetic moments and charge quadrupoles, mediated by the strong spin-orbit interaction, that leads to the unusual canted configuration of magnetic moments observed in these systems. When structural degrees of freedom are included, the two materials exhibit pronounced differences. In Ba$_2$MgReO$_6$ the strong coupling to Jahn-Teller distortions stabilizes the antiferroic $\\mathcal{Q}_{x^2-y^2}$ order, yielding excellent agreement with available experimental data. In contrast, the Jahn-Teller coupling is significantly weaker in Ba$_2$NaOsO$_6$ and appears insufficient to stabilize the antiferroic quadrupolar order.

Threading dislocations (TDs) can be electrochemically etched into transport pipelines that can carry the etchant through the NID layers to access the doped material. Experimentally this has been shown to involve a mechanism where the etching pathway may follow one TD into a doped layer and then propagate sideways through the doped layer to continue via a different TD. Across multiple layers this process creates complex pore structures that have been described as 'cascades'. Here, we build a stochastic simulation for the DBR etching process that can reproduce some key features of the observed microstructures including the cascade morphology. By comparing the simulation output to samples etched at a range of voltages, we show that we can reproduce variations in experimental chronoamperometry data with applied bias by varying the probability of etching the doped layers within the simulation. The outputs of the resulting simulations replicate the experimentally observed cascade morphology. At higher voltages, experimental data reveal a lower proportion of cascade features, a trend that is also replicated by the simulations for relevant probability values. Outputs of the simulations also correlate well with experimental chronoamperometry data for samples where - unlike in a DBR - the thicknesses of the doped layers vary through the epitaxial multilayer, suggesting that the probabilistic simulation can be applied to a range of structures to help understand the dislocation-mediated electrochemical etching process."}

The effective 2D number density and composition data were used to determine the required model parameters by minimizing the discrepancy between simulation and experimental results. The parameterized model allows for quantitative phase-field simulations of nucleation and growth of $β_1$ precipitates, which can be employed to optimize aging time to achieve a target number density of precipitates. This work highlights an approach to overcome the challenges associated with parameterizing a coupled phase-field and nucleation model."}

By extracting the coherent phonon spectrum, we evidence robust signatures of CDW correlations at temperature and doping ranges far beyond the phase boundary of long-range CDW order. Remarkably, we unveil short-range CDW correlations survive up to room temperature in $x = 0.32$ Sn-doped CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, supported by synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements. We point out the introduction of quenched disorder by Sn doping can pin the CDW and form static short-range CDW, which can explain the observed persistent CDW signatures. Our results thus corroborate the ubiquity and robustness of CDW correlations in Sn-doped CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and provide new insights on the role of disorders on the CDW correlations in AV$_3$Sb$_5$ family."}

Superconducting fluctuations validate the mean-field approximation at low temperatures but destroy pairing at higher temperatures. The charge-density-wave order competes with superconductivity, enhances the effective electron mass inversely with the chemical potential, and increases with the interaction strength $U$ and the temperature $T$. SDW order is rare and fragile, while an additional magnetic term induces subtle band splitting. These findings suggest e-e contributions to STO's transport anomalies and provide criteria to distinguish e-e from e-ph origins, offering insights for engineering higher $T_c$ in dilute systems."}

Branford", "Andrew L. Goodwin"], "title": "Responsive Disorder in a Metal-Organic Framework Enables Solid-State Reservoir Computing", "comment": null, "summary": "Complex systems with nonlinear response mechanisms can be applied as reservoir computers for energy-efficient machine learning tasks. Historically explored at the macro- and meso-scale, physical reservoir computing has recently been extended to the atomic scale via chemical mixtures with strong and dynamic heterogeneity. Here we explore the possibility that configurational degeneracy within disordered materials might form the basis for solid-state atomic-scale reservoirs. Our proof-of-concept uses the disordered metal-organic framework DUT-8, which undergoes a series of disorder-disorder transitions on exposure to different guest species. We show that variations in X-ray diffuse scattering associated with these transitions function as suitable readouts for machine learning applications. A combination of nonlinearity and memory effects in the DUT-8 response allows the system to carry out both classification and time-series machine learning tasks with accuracies comparable to those of mesoscale physical reservoir computers. Our results suggest a new avenue for exploiting correlated disorder in solid phases whenever the nature of that disorder can be modulated through external perturbations-a phenomenon we term `responsive disorder'."}
