Oliveira"], "title": "Scaling invariance: a bridge between geometry, dynamics and criticality", "comment": null, "summary": "Scale invariance is a central organizing principle in physics, underlying phenomena that range from critical behaviour in statistical mechanics to transport and chaos in nonlinear dynamical systems. Here we present a unified and physically motivated exploration of scaling concepts, emphasizing how invariance under rescaling transformations emerges across systems of increasing dynamical complexity. Rather than adopting a purely abstract approach, we combine simple geometrical constructions, analytical arguments, and prototypical dynamical models to build physical intuition. We begin with elementary, easily reproducible examples governed by a single control parameter, showing how power-law behaviour naturally arises when characteristic scales are absent. We then extend the discussion to nonlinear dynamical systems exhibiting local bifurcations, where two scaling variables control the relaxation toward stationary states. In this context, scaling invariance manifests through critical exponents, crossover phenomena, and critical slowing down, allowing systems of different dimensionality to be grouped into universality classes. Finally, we address continuous phase transitions in chaotic dynamical systems, including transitions from integrability to non-integrability and from bounded to unbounded diffusion. By drawing on concepts traditionally associated with statistical mechanics, such as order parameters, susceptibilities, symmetry breaking, elementary excitations, and topological defects, we show how these transitions can be interpreted within a coherent scaling framework. Taken together, the examples discussed here demonstrate that scaling invariance provides a unifying language for understanding structure, transport, and criticality in nonlinear systems, bridging deterministic dynamics and nonequilibrium statistical physics in a transparent and physically intuitive manner."}

While these effects have been predicted theoretically and observed in simulations, their microscopic origin has remained unclear. Here, we address this question using a mobility-based nonequilibrium approach, analysing the steady-state drift of a tracer driven through an interacting chiral fluid. We show that, under strong chirality, the tracer generates a reversed density wake, in which regions of particle accumulation and depletion are inverted compared to the achiral case. This structural inversion of the wake provides a unified physical mechanism underlying both enhanced diffusion and negative mobility. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these phenomena are robust to changes in the interaction potential, highlighting their generality as a consequence of odd mobility."}

Previous studies have shown that for kinetic proofreading networks in the limit of large network size the first-passage time distribution converges either to a delta or to an exponential distribution. Remarkably, these two forms correspond to the two extreme distributions of minimal and maximal entropy for a fixed mean, respectively. Here we build on the connection between first-passage times and graph theory to show that these two limits are not model-specific, but arise generically in Markovian networks from the distribution of the eigenvalues of the generator matrix. A deterministic peak emerges when infinitely many eigenvalues contribute, while the exponential limit arises from a single dominant eigenvalue. We also show that the exponential limit emerges robustly for reversible networks when a backward bias exists. In contrast, the deterministic limit is not obtained from a simple reversal of this condition, but under structurally tighter conditions, revealing a fundamental asymmetry between both regimes. Our theoretical analysis is illustrated and validated by computer simulations of one-step master equations and random networks."}

Historically explored at the macro- and meso-scale, physical reservoir computing has recently been extended to the atomic scale via chemical mixtures with strong and dynamic heterogeneity. Here we explore the possibility that configurational degeneracy within disordered materials might form the basis for solid-state atomic-scale reservoirs. Our proof-of-concept uses the disordered metal-organic framework DUT-8, which undergoes a series of disorder-disorder transitions on exposure to different guest species. We show that variations in X-ray diffuse scattering associated with these transitions function as suitable readouts for machine learning applications. A combination of nonlinearity and memory effects in the DUT-8 response allows the system to carry out both classification and time-series machine learning tasks with accuracies comparable to those of mesoscale physical reservoir computers. Our results suggest a new avenue for exploiting correlated disorder in solid phases whenever the nature of that disorder can be modulated through external perturbations-a phenomenon we term `responsive disorder'."}

In the center-of-mass frame the dynamics separates into Fourier normal modes. Although suitable couplings can make the system maximally superintegrable (so all bounded motions are periodic), resonance of the mode frequencies does not by itself ensure choreographic motion. We give an explicit criterion for choreographic symmetry of a $T$-periodic solution: invariance under the choreography generator (time shift $T/n$ combined with cyclic relabeling/rotation) holds if and only if every dynamically active Fourier sector satisfies a sectorwise phase condition. This yields a direct test for when a closed orbit can be realized as a single-trace $n$-body choreography. When several symmetry-distinct mode families are simultaneously excited, periodic motions are generically not single-trace; for generic superintegrable initial data the particles lie on distinct closed curves, producing multi-trace motion. In special cases this multi-trace structure organizes into sub-choreographies supported on distinct traces; we refer to this structured splitting as choreographic fragmentation. The cases $n=4,5,6$ are analyzed explicitly. In particular, for $n=6$ the maximally superintegrable resonance $1{:}2{:}3$ yields periodic but generically multi-trace dynamics, whereas a single-trace six-body choreography occurs only at the degenerate resonance $1{:}2{:}2$."}

In all geometries with a smooth infrared end-of-space we uncover a robust and universal qualitative feature: Krylov complexity exhibits oscillatory behaviour. The oscillation frequency is controlled by the confinement scale, while the amplitude depends on both the ultraviolet cutoff and the infrared scale. Additional conserved charges modify these patterns without altering their qualitative structure. We further compare our results with the Krylov complexity of the longitudinally perturbed Ising model. The qualitative agreement suggests that oscillatory behaviour of Krylov complexity constitutes a universal signature of confinement and provides a sensitive probe of infrared reorganisation in strongly coupled quantum field theories."}

In several families of unconventional superconductors, including transition-metal dichalcogenides and kagome metals, growing evidence points to a cooperative role of EPC and dynamic charge-density fluctuations (CDF) in stabilizing superconductivity. However, how the EPC strength evolves across phase diagrams and relates to superconducting properties in strongly correlated systems remains an open question. Here we investigate the interplay between phonons and the CDF recently identified in cuprate superconductors. Using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, we track the dispersion and intensity of bond-stretching phonons in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-δ}$ over wide ranges of doping, temperature, and momentum. We find that both the phonon softening at the CDF wave vector and the EPC strength, extracted from a pronounced phonon intensity anomaly, are maximized near $p = 0.19$, where superconducting properties are optimal and CDF intensity is strongest. These results identify dynamic charge-density fluctuations, rather than quasi-static charge density waves, as the dominant source of phonon renormalization in cuprates, and establish a direct correlation between EPC strength and the superconducting dome. More broadly, our measurements highlight EPC as a doping-dependent property of correlated materials, shaped by the electronic environment in which lattice vibrations are embedded."}

For comparison, we also perform microwave imaging of integer quantum Hall states away from neutrality, which host dissipationless chiral edge channels. The evolution of the edge signal as a function of the bulk gap is fundamentally different between the Landau level filling factor $ν= 0$ and $|ν| \\ge 1$ integer quantum Hall states, which can be qualitatively explained by numerical simulations and theoretical analysis.

Recent research typically considers problems in which the optimal solution is realized via conservative forces, but whether this situation applies depends on the problem's constraints. In systems with complex topologies like discrete networks, the optimal, dissipation-minimizing protocol involves applying nonconservative forces along cycles if the timescales of the transitions in the network are fixed. We show that although nonconservative driving is optimal in this setting, a conservative protocol exists whose dissipation is at most twice the optimal one. This finding is complemented with an example modeling transport across an energy barrier, which illustrates such improvements of order 1 explicitly. Qualitatively, conservative driving falls short of achieving optimality because direct transport across the barrier is avoided. We conclude with a discussion that the optimality of nonconservative driving might be a generic phenomenon: As fewer degrees of freedom can be optimized, additional degrees of freedom due to adding nonconservative forces become more significant."}

In the latter case, the cross states can be regarded as those physical states that possess a finite amount of entanglement; accordingly, all separable states are of this kind. We prove that, for any Hilbert space dimension, the separable states can be characterized as those cross states that minimize a suitable norm, i.e., the projective norm associated with the projective tensor product of two trace classes; all other cross states are density operators belonging to the projective tensor product space. This is a generalization of the classical cross norm criterion of separability. Finally, we define an extended real-valued entanglement function and study its main properties.

In particular, it is sign-problem-free when we assume the widely used Millis-Monien-Pines form for the phenomenological susceptibility in the effective action of the fluctuating local moment, even though these local moments are now subjected to Landau damping as a result of their coupling to the itinerant quasiparticle on the fermi surface.

Depending on the relative importance of the hole pocket and the electron pocket on the reconstructed fermi surface and the coupling strength to the local moment, the Drude component in $\\mathrm{Im}σ^{xy}(ω)$ can be either positive or negative.(full-length abstract can be found in the main text.)"}

Symmetry-aware descriptors constructed through a group-theoretical approach ensure rigorous incorporation of both lattice and spin-rotation symmetries. The framework is demonstrated using the prototypical s-d exchange model widely employed in spintronics. ML-enabled large-scale simulations reveal novel nonequilibrium phenomena, including anomalous coarsening of tetrahedral spin order on the triangular lattice and the freezing of phase separation dynamics in lightly hole-doped, strong-coupling square-lattice systems. These results establish ML force-field frameworks as scalable, accurate, and versatile tools for modeling nonequilibrium spin dynamics in itinerant magnets."}

Building upon our previous work that established a mapping from spin systems to QFTs in periodic geometries, we extend the correspondence to systems with boundaries, where boundary conditions play a crucial role in shaping the dynamics. Focusing on Majorana fermions, we derive the allowed boundary conditions from the requirement of inner product conservation and formulate their realization in spin systems. The corresponding spin model is shown to reproduce boundary conditions of QFT accurately when a free function in the spin model is appropriately chosen. As an explicit demonstration, we analyze a flat spacetime example, comparing spectra, mode functions, and linear responses between the continuum and lattice descriptions. Our findings confirm that open spin systems can successfully replicate QFT dynamics with boundaries."}

We found a new direction in this study. By applying a magnetic field to the material, we discover that SrCu2(BO3)2 exhibits a universal and metallic T-linear specific heat behavior in a large magnetitic field range close to the pressure of zero-field first order transition between plaquette-singlet and antiferromagnetic phases. Such an unexpected gapless response from an electronically gapped Mott insulator could be attributed to magnetized Dirac spinons liberated by the combined effect of magnetic field and pressure, consistently seen from our quantum many-body thermal tensor network computation of the Shastry-Sutherland model under magnetic field. Such a robust and universal T-linear specific heat phase points out the richness of the phase diagram of the material expanded by the axes of pressure and magnetic field and is calling for new theoretical frameworks to its full explanation."}

Pseudoentropy, defined as the von Neumann entropy of a transition matrix, is computed holographically from codimension-two extremal surfaces in dS space and is divergent due to the asymptotic bulk volume at future infinity. We show that a finite and regulator-independent definition follows from the on-shell action of conformal gravity in four and six dimensions, implemented through the replica construction. We illustrate the formalism for spherical entangling surfaces and small shape deformations thereof. The renormalized pseudoentropy isolates the universal contribution, which for a spherical entangling surface is proportional to the complex-valued central charge $a^\\star$ of the non-unitary CFT. On an equal footing, for infinitesimal deformations away from the sphere, we recover, at quadratic order in the deformation parameter, an analytic continuation of the Mezei-like formula in its anti-de Sitter counterpart."}

In this model, the classical BPS attractor mechanism exhibits flat directions, leaving scalar moduli on the black hole horizon unfixed, while the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy depends only on the charges. We show that the resulting one-loop correction to the black hole entropy acquires a nontrivial dependence on the horizon moduli and induces an effective quantum potential that dynamically stabilizes them at a preferred value.

In several families of unconventional superconductors, including transition-metal dichalcogenides and kagome metals, growing evidence points to a cooperative role of EPC and dynamic charge-density fluctuations (CDF) in stabilizing superconductivity. However, how the EPC strength evolves across phase diagrams and relates to superconducting properties in strongly correlated systems remains an open question. Here we investigate the interplay between phonons and the CDF recently identified in cuprate superconductors. Using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, we track the dispersion and intensity of bond-stretching phonons in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-δ}$ over wide ranges of doping, temperature, and momentum. We find that both the phonon softening at the CDF wave vector and the EPC strength, extracted from a pronounced phonon intensity anomaly, are maximized near $p = 0.19$, where superconducting properties are optimal and CDF intensity is strongest. These results identify dynamic charge-density fluctuations, rather than quasi-static charge density waves, as the dominant source of phonon renormalization in cuprates, and establish a direct correlation between EPC strength and the superconducting dome. More broadly, our measurements highlight EPC as a doping-dependent property of correlated materials, shaped by the electronic environment in which lattice vibrations are embedded."}

Here we investigate the leading singularities from the perspective of the Wilson loop expectation values to which these amplitudes are dual, in particular making use of the twistor Wilson loop formalism. We show that the factorisation of one-loop leading singularities of a null Wilson loop's expectation value into a product of tree-level objects is manifest at the level of twistor Wilson loop diagrams, and is a simple consequence of planarity, without appeal to e.g. unitarity on the amplitude side of the duality. We then use the same approach to derive compact formulae for the one-loop leading singularities of correlators of multiple light-like Wilson loop operators in terms of tree-level objects. Via the chiral box expansion, these formulae provide a simple route to writing down the $O(g^2)$ correlation function of any number of Wilson loops at any MHV degree."}

The contour function of the logarithmic negativity diverges only at the entangling points, while the contour function for the logarithm of the moments of the partial transpose is divergent also at the boundary of the bipartite subsystem, as functions of the position. In a two-dimensional conformal field theory, analytic expressions that describe these divergencies are discussed. In one spatial dimension, we explore the partial derivative of the logarithmic negativity of two adjacent intervals with respect to the logarithm of the harmonic ratio of their lengths while their ratio and the other parameters are kept fixed. Considering the ground state of the harmonic chain on the line and in the massive regime, we report numerical results showing that this quantity displays a monotonically decreasing behaviour."}
