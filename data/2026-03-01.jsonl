We demonstrate that increasing disorder leads to the emergence of locally superconducting regions characterized by an enhanced critical temperature $T_c^{\\ast}$, exceeding the bulk transition temperature $T_c$.\n  Both $T_c^\\ast$ and $T_c$ exhibit a nonmonotonic dependence on dopant concentration and show a strong correlation with entropy isotherms measured as a function of disorder. The pronounced entropy maxima coincide with the largest separation between $T_c^{\\ast}$ and $T_c$, establishing disorder as a thermodynamically controlled parameter governing superconductivity in these materials. Measurements of the upper critical field reveal distinct $H_{c2}(T)$ branches associated with the bulk and locally superconducting phases, providing direct experimental evidence for a percolative superconducting state.\n  To interpret these observations, we propose a microscopic model that captures the interplay between the impurity-induced enhancement of local pairing and the disorder-driven suppression of global superconducting coherence. The model reproduces the experimentally observed nonmonotonic evolution of $T_c^{\\ast}$ with disorder and supports a percolation-based interpretation of the superconducting transition. Our results demonstrate that controlled atomic disorder can serve as an effective materials-design parameter for tuning superconductivity in complex correlated systems."}

In this work, we demonstrate moire-induced CPDM states in a bilayer heterostructure formed by epitaxially stacking one quintuple layer (1 QL) of topological insulator Sb2Te3 on a six-unit-cell (6 UC) antiferromagnetic FeTe layer. Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/S) measurements reveal a moiré superlattice formed between the hexagonal Te lattice of Sb2Te3 and the square Te lattice of FeTe, which spatially modulates the two superconducting gaps of the 1 QL Sb2Te3/6 UC FeTe bilayer. Our Josephson STM/S measurements provide direct real-space imaging of the CPDM states with a wavelength corresponding to the periodicity of the moire superlattice. By substituting Sb2Te3 with Bi2Te3, we achieve control over both the periodicity and magnitude of the CPDM states.

In this study, we discover the emergence of chiral superconducting states in three-dimensional $g$-wave altermagnetic metals. Through systematic self-consistent mean-field analysis on the extended attractive Hubbard model combined with $g$-wave altermagnetic exchange fields in a three-dimensional hexagonal lattice, as observed in CrSb, we find that the altermagnetic spin splitting of Fermi surfaces favors chiral $p$-wave states as the dominant pairing channel under strong altermagnetic fields and high electron densities, while chiral $d$-wave states become predominant under weak altermagnetic fields and intermediate electron densities. Conversely, at weak altermagnetic fields and typical electron densities, non-chiral $s$-, extended $s$-, or $f$-wave states become stabilized. We also showcase the possible experimental detection using the quasiparticle energy dispersions and the density of states to distinguish different pairing symmetries.

More concretely, a metric network is a network whose edges are each assigned a notion of length and a coordinate describing position. One can then define function spaces and differential operators on these objects to model the aforementioned systems. Recent software advancements have made it feasible to analyze partial differential equations on large, compact metric networks with a vast array of structures. Here, we generate compact metric network structures using the spatial tessellations of two-dimensional hyperuniform point patterns, which have suppressed large-scale density fluctuations relative to typical disordered point patterns. This choice of structure is inspired by the exotic physical properties of network materials with these structures in other contexts. Then, we characterize the eigenvalue spectrum structure of the differential Laplace operator on these networks. In particular, we find that gaps can form in the eigenvalue spectra of these networks whose widths increase when the distribution of edge lengths is narrow and as the number of triangular faces increases. Importantly, many of the structures we consider are realizable in Euclidean space, meaning they are well-suited for practical applications in, e.g., metamaterial design. This work can thus be used to inform the design of metric network-based systems with spectral gaps with tunable widths and locations."}

We validate the CID across systems of increasing complexity, beginning with single-component Lennard-Jones melting before examining binary phase separation, polymer condensation and dispersion, and assembly of amorphous carbon networks at multiple densities. Unlike conventional order parameters, CID requires no a priori knowledge of relevant structural features and captures entropic signatures across a variety of molecular systems and discretization resolutions.

We introduce a new toolkit, the Simulator Collection for Atomic-to-Continuum Scales (SCACS), which uses a graph neural network to predict SPTC on large atomic structures, coarse-grain these fields into anisotropic conductivity tensors, and embeds them into the heat-flow FE equation with a customized, anisotropy-aware adaptive mesh refinement scheme. Applied to silicon nanostructures, the resulting FE models act as representative volume elements, reproduce bulk conductivities, and capture interfacial and defect-driven anisotropy while maintaining thermodynamic consistency.

Specifically, bigger values of $α$ enhance the tendency toward BCS instability. For $α\\in(0.001,0.61)$, the $(Q,φ)$ parameter space separates into two distinct regions: Zone-\\uppercase\\expandafter{\\romannumeral1}, where Cooper instability is suppressed, and Zone-\\uppercase\\expandafter{\\romannumeral2}, where it is allowed.

Using linear spin-wave theory for the mixed-spin model, we demonstrate that triangular-lattice-like arrangements yield a larger average staggered magnetization than both random and square-lattice-like cases.

For example, the energy on the NL is equal to the energy of the pure Ising model at the effective temperature up to a constant and a trivial factor.

We focus particularly on asymmetric orbifolds, which are examples of non-geometric string compactifications and constitute an intriguing corner in the string landscape. We describe the orbifolds using two complementary approaches; the duality twists and the lattice approach. First, we discuss the general construction of freely acting (asymmetric) orbifolds, focusing on the closed string sector. Afterwards, we present explicit examples of orbifolds preserving $\\mathcal{N} = 6,4,2$ or $0$ supersymmetry in five dimensions and we demonstrate the connection between freely acting orbifolds and Scherk-Schwarz reductions by matching the lightest untwisted orbifold states with those arising form the effective supergravity theory. Regarding the orbifold twisted sectors, we show that at special points in the moduli space, generically massive states can become massless. Furthermore, we show that the spectrum of non-supersymmetric orbifolds can become tachyon-free away from special loci in the moduli space. Next, we turn our attention to the orbifold moduli space, and we focus on orbifolds preserving $\\mathcal{N} = 2$ supersymmetry in five dimensions, for which we determine the classical hypermultiplet and vector multiplet moduli spaces. Moreover, by constructing dual orbifold pairs, we argue that no quantum corrections to the metric on the vector multiplet moduli space arise. Then, we discuss aspects of the swampland program in the context of freely acting asymmetric orbifolds and we verify that the swampland distance conjecture is valid in the non-geometric compactifications of string theory studied in this thesis. Finally, we focus on the D-brane spectrum of freely acting orbifolds and we determine the conditions under which the various D-branes survive the orbifolding."}

By studying the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model using exact diagonalization, we demonstrate that in in half-filled and topologically-trivial bands, quantum geometric properties of the Bloch states alone can act as a tuning knob for Mott metal-to-insulator and affect the competition between ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism.

We find that by 1000 eV, well above the ~285 eV of the C $K$-edge, the SHG of diamond is dominated by the bulk, quadrupole response, in agreement with our analytic calculations. The bulk response continues to grow as the energy is increased, becoming overwhelming by 7000 eV.

On top of this band structure we introduce chiral $p$-wave and $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconducting channels and determine the layer-dependent gap amplitudes self-consistently. The chiral $p$-wave order parameter is strongly enhanced at the outermost layers and decays within only a few layers towards the interior, while the $d$-wave order parameter is more than an order of magnitude smaller on all layers. The quasiparticle dispersion and surface local density of states in the chiral $p$-wave state show that the drumhead band is efficiently gapped out and that the zero-energy peak in the normal surface spectrum is split into two coherence peaks, directly reflecting the induced superconducting gap. These results demonstrate that superconductivity driven by drumhead surface states is naturally biased toward a surface-localized chiral $p$-wave pairing symmetry and may offer qualitative guidance for interpreting surface-sensitive experiments on Pd-doped CaAgP."}

Focusing on the one-dimensional SSH--Hubbard chain on a ring as a controlled interacting topological model, we introduce a $U(1)$ twist $θ$ (flux insertion). The many-body ground state along the full twist cycle is computed by the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG), while the onsite interaction $U$ is tuned from the noninteracting to the strong-coupling regime. At half filling in the inversion-symmetric gapped regime, our DMRG calculations show that the density remains constant within numerical accuracy over the entire $(θ,U)$ range studied. Thus, the density has no dependence on either the flux $θ$ or the interaction strength $U$. Accordingly, the symmetry-preserving density constraint collapses the KS reference to an SSH-type quadratic representative with $U$-independent geometric diagnostics. Nevertheless, the many-body wave function exhibits a nontrivial geometric response: the quantum metric associated with the $θ$-parametrized ground-state manifold depends on $θ$ at intermediate $U$ and is strongly suppressed at large $U$, consistent with the charge fluctuation freezing. Intriguingly, the KS and many-body Berry phases coincide throughout the gapped regime as $U$ is tuned from weak to strong coupling.

By combining Bayesian optimization with automated optical evaluation of the Urbach energy as a metric of sub-bandgap disorder, the self-driving system efficiently identifies heteroepitaxial growth conditions yielding a minimum Urbach energy of 182 meV, the lowest value for sputtered beta-Ga2O3 films. Importantly, the optimized growth window is transferable, realizing single-crystalline beta-Ga2O3 homoepitaxy without further optimization, corroborated by scanning transmission electron microscopy. To convert the closed-loop dataset into interpretable growth rules, we train a random forest surrogate and distill it into response curves and quantified pairwise interactions across the four-dimensional growth-parameter space. This analysis identifies substrate temperature as the primary control knob, with RF power and gas flows acting largely additively and only a modest temperature-oxygen coupling delineating the narrow window for high-quality growth, establishing a general route from autonomous experimentation to transferable growth rules."}

A finite infrared TDOS defines a new universality class of memory--dominated critical dynamics characterized by long--time kernels $K(t)\\sim1/t$ and nonanalytic dynamical response. This spectral reorganization produces a strong infrared amplification of the particle--particle channel, converting the marginal instabilities of BCS and Eliashberg theories into algebraic superconducting transitions. As a result, the transition temperature scales linearly with the infrared spectral weight of slow collective modes, naturally yielding superconducting domes and Uemura scaling without invoking bosonic glue or fine tuning. The same slow--mode reservoir governs anomalous normal--state dynamics, including long--time correlations and strange--metal behavior, providing a unified description of thermodynamic and dynamical phenomena in correlated superconductors. Our results establish dynamical spectral organization as a fundamental principle of quantum critical matter and identify memory--dominated criticality as a generic route to high--temperature superconductivity."}

We analyze two standard DSR realizations (Amelino--Camelia and Magueijo--Smolin, parametrized by an invariant energy scale $k$) as well as a generalized DSR framework based on a first-order expansion in the Planck length $l_p$.

The empirical analysis carried out in this study led to the development of a predictive model that enables estimation of SAMAX and SRMAX values based exclusively on beta1. This methodology represents a significant step toward the rational design of lifetime-based luminescence thermometers with predefined thermometric characteristics tailored to the requirements of specific applications."}

In that regime Poisson noise remains important. We obtain the large deviations of the position of a given particle by two methods. The first derives asymptotics of $q$-TASEP Fredholm determinant formula. The second maps the weak noise limit to a system of semi-discrete or fully discrete, non linear differential equations. These are obtained as saddle point classical equations of a dynamical field theory, and their solutions represent the optimal configurations in the large deviation regime. We show the classical integrability of these two systems, and exhibit their explicit Lax pair. In the case of the continuous time $q$-TASEP it provides the first instance of classical integrability arising in a stochastic system, with signatures of the Poisson noise persisting in the weak noise limit. For this model, we solve the scattering problem associated to its Lax pair and fully characterize the large deviations associated to the weak noise theory. Finally, we supplement this work with an Appendix on the first cumulant method to obtain the large deviations of several lattice polymer models (Strict Weak, Log Gamma, Beta)."}

Starting from the nonlinear $O(3)$ sigma model, we explicitly construct its classical mapping to the $CP^1$ formulation, emphasizing the emergence of a local $U(1)$ gauge symmetry intrinsically linked to the Fubini-Study target-space geometry. Focusing on the static sector, we analyze magnetized BPS lump configurations. By examining the topological boundary conditions, we show that the magnetic flux is quantized and fully determined by the asymptotic behavior of the gauge field. Within the BPS framework, we identify the specific self-interaction potential required for the existence of self-dual configurations. A detailed analysis of the asymptotic behavior, both near the lump core and at spatial infinity, demonstrates that finite-energy solutions necessarily correspond to lump-like BPS configurations in the $CP^1$ target space, with the scalar field vanishing asymptotically. The resulting BPS equations are solved numerically, and the main physical properties of the solutions are presented. We find that these configurations are regular, magnetically localized, and energetically stable, with their internal structure rigidly controlled by the geometry of the $CP^1$ target space.

This effect limits the use of most phosphors in high-power/high-temperature applications, such as outdoor lighting and laser systems. To achieve anti-TQ properties, structural design of phosphors is required. This usually follows two guidelines: (1) increasing lattice rigidity to minimize thermal expansion; (2) converting thermal energy into radiative transitions to compensate for the non-radiative losses. While metal oxides and metal nitrides dominate the field of commercial anti-TQ phosphors, metal halides - despite their inherently soft lattices - have shown remarkable progress as anti-TQ phosphors in recent years. Here, we review the advances in anti-TQ metal halides (covering the time span from 2017, when first reports have appeared, till today) and discuss their mechanisms and applications. We argue that the low synthesis temperatures of metal halides and their high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) make them promising candidates as anti-TQ phosphors. Furthermore, since the rich optical-physical processes underlying the anti-TQ effect in soft-lattice in metal halides are only now beginning to be unraveled, this creates opportunities for many fundamental investigations."}

The former is connected to the Haldane phase, stabilized by large inter-chain coupling, via the topological Gaussian transition. Upon decreasing the inter-chain interactions, this intermediate disorder phase vanishes, giving place to a dimerized phase separated from the plaquette phase on one side via a non-magnetic Ising transition and from the Haldane phase on the other side by a topological weak first-order transition.

In a custom automated reactor, a kilogram-scale powder bed reversibly stores 42g H2 and sustains 96+/-3% capacity utilization over 30 redox cycles.

The basic fields are formulated in terms of two-component spin-tensors in (A)dS space where the tracelessness conditions are automatically fulfilled.

A conversion procedure for transforming second-class constraints into first-class ones is developed, allowing one to construct a Hermitian and nilpotent BRST charge in the Fock space under consideration. It is proven that the hermiticity and nilpotency restrict the conditions on the theory parameters, which are fulfilled only in dS space. The hermiticity of the BRST charge is incompatible with AdS space. The gauge invariant Lagrangian is constructed on the basis of the BRST charge, and for spin $s$ and depth $t$ the allowed states in the Lagrangian include only $(s-t)$ Stückelberg fields.

Although more complex descriptors may improve numerical accuracy, they often represent extra computational load, also reducing transparency into the underlying structural information. A framework called the Dynamic Collision Fingerprint (DCF) was recently proposed with the goal of producing concise, physically significant representations, generating descriptors via dynamical probing of atomic structures. In this work, we benchmark DCF using a dataset composed of 120 two-dimensional carbon allotropes and compare its performance with the widely considered Matminer library. The analysis employs three regression models, linear regression, decision tree, and XGBoost, evaluated over train and test partitions ranging from 10\\% to 90\\% and repeated over multiple random seeds in order to characterize statistical variability. The obtained results demonstrate that DCF easily matches Matminer in terms of predicting accuracy across all learning algorithms. However, it accomplishes this using descriptors that are significantly lower dimensional, pointing to manageable computing costs. Moreover, compared to the rather technical Matminer descriptions, the DCF exhibits considerably clearer physical interpretability. These findings suggest that DCF is a significant substitute for high-dimensional descriptor libraries as structural representation since it is both computationally flexible and physically grounded."}

Optical emission spectroscopy reveals that, unlike pulsed-DCMS where Ar$^{+}$ ions dominate, HiPIMS discharges are characterised by strong Y$^{+}$ emission, evidencing high yttrium ionisation and substantial self-sputter recycling. The critical working pressure (P$_c$) required to obtain transparent and photochromic films is higher for HiPIMS (Pc $\\approx$ 1.0 Pa) than for pulsed-DCMS (Pc $\\approx$ 0.5 Pa). Although films deposited near Pc exhibit similar solar transmittance (~72 %) and lattice parameters (5.38--5.39 Å), the pulsed-DCMS film shows a substantially higher relative photochromic contrast (34 %) and a lower optical band gap (2.70 eV) compared with the HiPIMS film (9 % contrast and 2.94 eV). This difference is partly attributed to a lower oxygen-to-hydrogen atomic ratio in the pulsed-DCMS film.

In this study, we discover the emergence of chiral superconducting states in three-dimensional $g$-wave altermagnetic metals. Through systematic self-consistent mean-field analysis on the extended attractive Hubbard model combined with $g$-wave altermagnetic exchange fields in a three-dimensional hexagonal lattice, as observed in CrSb, we find that the altermagnetic spin splitting of Fermi surfaces favors chiral $p$-wave states as the dominant pairing channel under strong altermagnetic fields and high electron densities, while chiral $d$-wave states become predominant under weak altermagnetic fields and intermediate electron densities. Conversely, at weak altermagnetic fields and typical electron densities, non-chiral $s$-, extended $s$-, or $f$-wave states become stabilized. We also showcase the possible experimental detection using the quasiparticle energy dispersions and the density of states to distinguish different pairing symmetries.

However, first-principles methods, such as DFT, are often computationally extremely expensive for feasible large-scale screenings. Given such a scenario, we address a data-driven approach which integrates the semi-empirical Extended Huckel Method with machine learning techniques to estimate adsorption energy barriers in the case of three relevant chalcogen impurities, S, Se and Te. With this aim, we consider the 4036 2D materials found in the C2DB. The scheme employs the EHM to compute energy profiles along three in-plane migration paths, from which average barriers can be derived. The equilibrium distance between the impurity and the 2D surface is not calculated from a tie-consuming geometry optimization. Instead, it is estimated from a simple effective phenomenological expression. Physicochemical descriptors are then obtained from the Matminer library for curated features. Four different ML models are tested, with the XGBoost leading to the highest performance. We further use SHAP to verify the resulting predictions, focusing on the $\\sim1,500$ materials displaying the lowest barrier values. As it could be anticipated, we establish that the average valence electron count, electronegativity, and atomic number are typically the most relevant attributes to validate the ML model. But we also are able to determine, for the different chalcogen atoms, which other few descriptors likewise considerably influence the adsorption properties. Our results show that when combined with interpretable ML protocols, EHM can produce a scalable framework for choosing 2D structures that exhibit the desired capture/release dynamics pertinent in a variety of utilization."}

Disorder of type $Δ_1$ or $Δ_2$ enhances superconductivity by reducing the critical interaction threshold $|λ_c|$ and expanding the superconducting phase space (Zone-\\uppercase\\expandafter{\\romannumeral2}). In sharp contrast, either $Δ_0$ or $Δ_3$ suppresses Cooper pairing by increasing $|λ_c|$ and shrinking the available phase space (Zone-\\uppercase\\expandafter{\\romannumeral1}). Although Cooper instability can be enhanced when promotive disorders ($Δ_1$, $Δ_2$) coexist with a single suppressive disorder ($Δ_0$ or $Δ_3$), the suppressive influence of $Δ_{0,3}$ generally dominates the promotive effects of $Δ_{1,2}$ in the presence of all sorts of disorders. These results would be helpful for further studies of fractional Dirac semimetals and alike materials."}

Li3PS4 (Li2S-P2S5) glasses are among the most studied due to their high ionic conductivity, traditionally ascribed to rotational motion of polyhedral units facilitating Li+ migration. Using ab initio molecular dynamics, we investigate Li-ion diffusion in Li3PS4 glass, demonstrating that our structural model reproduces experimental neutron and X-ray diffraction patterns and conductivity measurements. Importantly, we identify a previously unrecognized diffusion mechanism: Li+ ions near isolated sulfur species (Sn with n = 1, 3) display significantly enhanced mobility, with atomic displacements up to 1.7 greater than those associated with bulkier polyhedral units. These results highlight the critical role of free sulfur species in promoting fast ionic transport, providing insights for the rational design of glass compositions with optimized conductivity for solid-state battery applications"}

These phenomena emerge exclusively within the superconducting fluctuation regime of thin samples, consistent with the enhanced anomalous metallic behavior of atomically thin NbSe2. The non-monotonic temperature dependence of both the oscillation amplitude and the diode efficiency can be captured by a model in which thermally activated vortices traverse intrinsic supercurrent loops.

An atomistic multiscale framework, coupling molecular dynamics (MD) and kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations, was developed to investigate the underlying atomistic mechanisms behind dislocation-relaxation peaks. MD simulations revealed that the presence of hydrogen atoms near the dislocation core facilitates the kink nucleation process by reducing the nucleation barrier while enhancing the barrier for dislocation migration. The KMC model captured Snoek-Koster peaks arising from the Cottrell atmosphere formed by hydrogen atoms and clusters around the dislocation core, providing insights into the atomistic mechanisms controlling these relaxations. Furthermore, the proposed computational scheme elucidated a unique linear relationship between hydrogen content and the internal friction loss factor, offering a methodology for hydrogen detection and quantification."}

Linear optical constants are extracted using spectroscopic ellipsometry and applied in fitting the harmonic generation behavior. Polarization-resolved SHG and THG measurements exhibit pronounced anisotropy, with emission patterns well-described by theoretical models derived from the khi(2) and khi(3) tensor elements. The material demonstrates exceptionally high nonlinear susceptibilities, with khi(2) ~ 10^(-8) m/V and khi(3) ~ 10^(-17) m^2/V^2 which is a few orders of magnitude greater than comparable 2D materials reported in the literature. Temperature-dependent SHG and THG measurements from 300 K to 25 K reveal exponential decay in harmonic signal intensities, attributed to reduced carrier mobility, with no evidence of structural phase transitions, consistent with results from single crystal diffraction and heat capacity measurements. Polarization-resolved SHG and THG measurements also reveal distinct orientation and ellipticity trends, highlighting the anisotropic nonlinear tensor contributions and contrasting polarization selection rules in the material.

To overcome this bottleneck, we present a machine learning electron-phonon interaction (MLEPI) pipeline that predicts force constants and electronic Hamiltonians for modeling EPIs from finite difference calculations, improving efficiency by orders of magnitude without compromising accuracy. The performance of MLEPI is validated by studying the temperature dependence of the electronic band properties in bilayer graphene, where both first- and second order EPIs are treated on an equal footing. Using a heterogeneous edge network, the pipeline integrates both interlayer and intralayer interactions, making it particularly suitable for studying multilayer materials. With its inherent adaptability and ease of transfer to other applications, our methodology provides a robust tool with a very favorable accuracy/efficiency balance for investigating EPIs in large-scale material systems."}

The generation of coordination compounds of Dy with large magnetic anisotropy represents a topical example, where multireference simulations of large molecules are necessary to perform reliable predictions.

Our Josephson STM/S measurements provide direct real-space imaging of the CPDM states with a wavelength corresponding to the periodicity of the moire superlattice.
